_UNK_ members of the House Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation that would restrict how the new savings-and-loan bailout agency can raise capital , creating another potential obstacle to the government `s sale of sick thrifts .
The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan _UNK_ -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an _UNK_ bank or thrift issue debt that would n`t be counted on the federal budget .
The bill intends to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only , unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization .
`` Such agency ` _UNK_ ` borrowing is unauthorized and expensive , far more expensive than direct Treasury borrowing , `` said Rep. _UNK_ _UNK_ -LRB- D. , Calif. -RRB- , the bill `s chief sponsor .
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $ 30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC .
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from _UNK_ the budget deficit .
Another $ 20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds , which pay lower interest rates .
But the RTC also requires `` working `` capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately .
That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold , leaving the total spending for the bailout at $ 50 billion , or $ _UNK_ billion including interest over 10 years .
`` It `s a problem that clearly has to be resolved , `` said David _UNK_ , executive director of the RTC .
The agency has already spent roughly $ 19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls , and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes .
_UNK_ other working capital , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets .
`` We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward , `` he said .
The complicated language in the huge new law has _UNK_ the fight .
The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $ 5 billion at any time .
Moreover , it says the RTC `s total obligations may not exceed $ 50 billion , but that figure is derived after including notes and other debt , and _UNK_ from it the market value of the assets the RTC holds .
But Congress did n`t anticipate or intend more public debt , say opponents of the RTC `s _UNK_ plan , and Rep. Charles _UNK_ -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- said the RTC _UNK_ Board has been _UNK_ in not keeping Congress informed .
`` That _UNK_ leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of _UNK_ , `` he said .
`` The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior _UNK_ on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility . ``
The Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on the bill next Tuesday .
We `re about to see if advertising works .
_UNK_ on the heels of Friday `s 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that `s followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads _UNK_ a familiar message : _UNK_ on investing , the market `s just fine .
Their mission is to keep clients from _UNK_ the market , as individual investors did in _UNK_ after the crash in October
Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors .
This time around , they `re moving even faster .
PaineWebber Inc. _UNK_ a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads .
It considered running them during tomorrow night `s World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday .
Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were _UNK_ out potential new ad strategies .
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when _UNK_ investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .
This time , the firms were ready .
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge .
When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers .
The ads _UNK_ Fidelity `s automated _UNK_ beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is _UNK_ For Your Call . ``
A Fidelity spokesman says the _UNK_ , which already was operating but which many clients did n`t know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .
`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , `` he says .
`` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .
It would have been too late to think about on Friday .
We had to think about it ahead of time . ``
Today `s Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity .
_UNK_ the headline `` _UNK_ , `` it _UNK_ , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market `s volatility . ``
It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name .
PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which _UNK_ would agree to air its last-minute _UNK_ .
The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary _UNK_ , one of the firm `s most visible investment strategists , _UNK_ particularly bullish .
_UNK_ just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. _UNK_ advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... .
We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation . ``
The spot was scheduled to appear three times on _UNK_ last night .
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks .
Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its _UNK_ to keep that money in the market .
`` We `re saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , `` says John _UNK_ , PaineWebber `s director of advertising .
`` If you owned it and _UNK_ it Friday , the true value has n`t changed . ``
He adds , `` This is n`t 1987 _UNK_ . ``
With the market _UNK_ and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly _UNK_ their approach .
At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to _UNK_ yesterday afternoon .
The plan had been to make one of Shearson `s _UNK_ , _UNK_ `` Where We _UNK_ `` commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 .
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson `s new ad campaign , `` _UNK_ by _UNK_ . ``
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad .
`` We do n`t think at this point anything needs to be said .
The market seems to be _UNK_ out ; we `re taking a _UNK_ attitude , `` says _UNK_ B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing .
In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .
In 1987 , despite a _UNK_ of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en _UNK_ .
Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .

Edward _UNK_ , former chairman of Della Femina , McNamee _UNK_ , reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising , a small Boston shop .
Terms were n`t disclosed .
Mr. _UNK_ , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold .
John _UNK_ , the agency `s president and chief executive , will retain the title of president .
Separately , McDonald `s Corp. , _UNK_ _UNK_ , Ill. , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ 4 million cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn. , area .
That account had been handled by Della Femina , McNamee WCRS .

The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and _UNK_ off a two-year Business _UNK_ initiative on education .
The magazine will distribute 10 % of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers .
You know what the law of averages is , do n`t you ?
It `s what 1 -RRB- explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than _UNK_ Jackson ; 2 -RRB- _UNK_ that it `s possible to _UNK_ in a _UNK_ that averages two feet deep ; and 3 -RRB- predicts that 10,000 _UNK_ placed before 10,000 _UNK_ would produce _UNK_ _UNK_ rock _UNK_ roll _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , that game of the long haul , is the _UNK_ sport of the mean , and the mean _UNK_ law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend .
The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago _UNK_ in the National League _UNK_ was held to just one in two games by the _UNK_ Oakland A `s , the _UNK_ that had been done _UNK_ similarly by the Los Angeles _UNK_ and _UNK_ _UNK_ in last year `s _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , much of the damage was _UNK_ by A `s who had some _UNK_ up to do .
In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of _UNK_ autumn , a lot of the _UNK_ up was done by the A `s _UNK_ , Terry _UNK_ .
He hit a _UNK_ pitch from _UNK_ _UNK_ into the _UNK_ stands in _UNK_ four to stretch his team `s lead from _UNK_ to a _UNK_ _UNK_ , where it stayed .
So what if _UNK_ had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games , and _UNK_ in the seventh position of the A `s lineup .
`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , `` he later _UNK_ .
On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold _UNK_ away successes to _UNK_ the pain of past and , no doubt , future _UNK_ .
Mark _UNK_ , the big , _UNK_ Oakland first _UNK_ , had three hits in four at _UNK_ , two more than he `d had in the _UNK_ _UNK_ series in which he `d gone _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ 6 through 9 , _UNK_ the `` bottom of the order , `` got seven of their team `s 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a _UNK_ decision .
_UNK_ Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday _UNK_ .
That he was the A `s _UNK_ _UNK_ during its American League campaign with a _UNK_ mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the _UNK_ , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his _UNK_ _UNK_ is _UNK_ , that might not be this week .
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who _UNK_ early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven _UNK_ in Sunday `s contest .
`` Every guy they put out there had a better _UNK_ than the guy before , `` _UNK_ Giant manager Roger Craig .
He `s an _UNK_ who `s one of the leading _UNK_ of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a _UNK_ until it _UNK_ beneath the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ of the _UNK_ is that the A `s go into San Francisco `s Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ to _UNK_ with here says that about three of four clubs -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that took _UNK_ Series leads went on to win it all .
That `s not an average to _UNK_ Giant _UNK_ .
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the _UNK_ _UNK_ BART -LRB- that `s a better name for a public _UNK_ than `` _UNK_ , `` do n`t you think ? -RRB- would have been _UNK_ over the proceedings , but they _UNK_ them in relative calm .
_UNK_ of the two _UNK_ sat side by side in the _UNK_ seats of Oakland _UNK_ , and while they _UNK_ their _UNK_ and _UNK_ the opposition , _UNK_ advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .
A few folks even showed up wearing _UNK_ bearing the colors and _UNK_ of both teams .
`` I `m for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .
I love _UNK_ both .
The only thing I `m _UNK_ for is for the Series to go seven games , `` said David Williams , a Sacramento _UNK_ , at the _UNK_ before Sunday `s go .
The above represents a _UNK_ of either _UNK_ or _UNK_ .
I choose to believe it `s the latter , although it probably _UNK_ from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A `s and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .
_UNK_ it to say that if this were a New York _UNK_ series , or one between the Chicago _UNK_ and White _UNK_ -LRB- _UNK_ , it `s possible -RRB- , you `d need _UNK_ police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the _UNK_ would _UNK_ their _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , the A `s gave you a lot of heroes to root for .
In the opening game , besides _UNK_ and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ who had lost a couple months of the season to _UNK_ surgery .
He was _UNK_ _UNK_ -LRB- _UNK_ in game two -RRB- , moved a _UNK_ along in the A `s _UNK_ second _UNK_ , and _UNK_ for his team `s final _UNK_ .
Such is his reputation among the East Bay _UNK_ that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an _UNK_ .
Not his _UNK_ ; _UNK_ _UNK_ `s .
An A `s _UNK_ of the second game was _UNK_ Henderson , who _UNK_ the hot side of the _UNK_ _UNK_ .
He _UNK_ Toronto in the _UNK_ with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at _UNK_ , and continued that by going _UNK_ at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and _UNK_ a run .
`` When you `re in the _UNK_ , you see every ball _UNK_ , `` he _UNK_ .
The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and _UNK_ Williams , the Giants ` _UNK_ _UNK_ .
They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs _UNK_ in in the five games against the _UNK_ .
They went a collective _UNK_ here , with zero _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
It `s that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come .
`` I believe in the law of averages , `` declared San Francisco _UNK_ coach _UNK_ Baker after game two .
`` I `d rather see a _UNK_ _UNK_ who `s hot come up for the other side than a good _UNK_ who `s cold . ``
But the old _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ offered no _UNK_ about when good times would return to his side .
`` When it goes , you never know when you `ll get it back , `` he said .
`` That `s baseball .
_UNK_ Corp. reported a 10 % drop in third-quarter net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip .
Net income for the quarter fell to $ _UNK_ million from $ _UNK_ million , roughly what analysts had expected .
But per-share profit dropped only 2 % to $ 1.23 a share from $ 1.26 a share , as the company continued its stock buy-back plan .
Average shares outstanding dropped to _UNK_ million from _UNK_ million .
Revenue fell 1 % to $ _UNK_ billion from $ _UNK_ billion .
The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U.S. , also said the negative effect of a stronger U.S. dollar will `` _UNK_ affect `` its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it difficult `` to better 1988 results .
_UNK_ said revenue declined both in the U.S. and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .
The company , however , said orders in the U.S. showed `` good gains `` during the latest quarter .
Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of _UNK_ `s major customers .
In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , _UNK_ , which sells automated _UNK_ machines and computerized cash _UNK_ , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , `` notes _UNK_ G. _UNK_ , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should _UNK_ affect the current quarter `s results , _UNK_ said .
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , _UNK_ had profit of $ _UNK_ million , or $ 1.85 a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion .
Mr. _UNK_ said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ _UNK_ a share from $ _UNK_ a share .
Revenue projections were slashed to $ _UNK_ billion from $ _UNK_ billion .
Last year , _UNK_ had net income of $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , on $ _UNK_ billion in revenue .
For the nine months , the company `s earnings fell 9 % to $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , from $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share .
_UNK_ declined 1 % to $ _UNK_ billion from $ _UNK_ billion .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , _UNK_ shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 57 .
_UNK_ your Sept. 19 article `` Wall Street Firms _UNK_ Analysts ` _UNK_ to _UNK_ , `` I `m _UNK_ that Wall Street is finally _UNK_ in to the hard , cold facts of the real working world .
If the firms are serious , however , why limit the practice to the poor , _UNK_ analysts whose ability to see into the future is fragile at best ?
Why not extend the same harsh standards to the sales force , and pay brokers a base salary with annual bonus based on how much money they made for their clients during the year ?
That should stop a lot of _UNK_ , and produce a stock market driven only by professional concern , careful thought and good sense .
Now , would n`t that be a _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ Newport News , Va .
Steve Clark , a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. trader , reported for work at 5 a.m. , two and a half hours before the usual Monday morning strategy meeting .
At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis _UNK_ did n`t reach the office until _UNK_ a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home .
`` I had calls all night long from the States , `` he said .
`` I was _UNK_ up every hour -- _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
People are looking for possible opportunities to buy , but nobody wants to stick their _UNK_ out . ``
For many of London `s securities traders , it was a day that started _UNK_ in the small hours .
By _UNK_ , the selling was at _UNK_ fever .
But as the day ended in a _UNK_ Wall _UNK_ rally , the City _UNK_ a _UNK_ of relief .
So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London `s financial district .
In the wake of Wall Street `s plunge last Friday , the London market was considered especially vulnerable .
And before the opening of trading here yesterday , all eyes were on early trading in Tokyo for a _UNK_ as to how widespread the fallout might be .
By the time trading officially got under way at 9 a.m. , the news from Asia was in .
And it left mixed signals for London .
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but _UNK_ 1.8 % on thin volume ; Hong Kong stocks declined 6.5 % in _UNK_ trading .
At Jefferies ` trading room on _UNK_ Circus , a _UNK_ circle at the edge of the financial district , desktop computer screens displayed the London market `s major barometer -- the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index .
Red figures on the screens indicated falling stocks ; blue figures , rising stocks .
Right away , the _UNK_ outnumbered the _UNK_ , 80 to 20 , as the index opened at _UNK_ , off _UNK_ points , or 7 % .
`` I see concern , but I do n`t see any panic , `` said Mr. _UNK_ , a big , _UNK_ New York native who runs the _UNK_ office .
The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it _UNK_ , seeking to avoid risk .
`` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , `` said David Smith , who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks .
`` We tend to run a very tight book . ``
Jefferies spent most of its _UNK_ in the morning trying to match buyers and sellers , and there were n`t many buyers .
`` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & _UNK_ , B.A.T , _UNK_ -- are getting pretty well _UNK_ this morning , `` Mr. Smith said .
_UNK_ later , a _UNK_ `` sell `` order for Scottish & _UNK_ came in .
For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the _UNK_ area to have a cigarette .
On the screens , only two _UNK_ blue figures remained , but the index had recovered a few points and was off about 140 .
`` Because Tokyo did n`t collapse , let `s pick up a little stock , `` Mr. Smith said .
He targeted _UNK_ shares of _UNK_ and _UNK_ a _UNK_ to call up on his screen other dealers ` price quotes .
The _UNK_ yellow figures showed the best price at _UNK_ pence , -LRB- $ _UNK_ -RRB- and Mr. Smith `s traders started putting out _UNK_ .
But the market _UNK_ a serious buyer on a day dominated by selling , and the quotes immediately jumped to 850 pence .
`` When I want to buy , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , `` Mr. Smith said .
`` It `s very _UNK_ . ``
He temporarily abandoned his search for the _UNK_ shares .
By this time , it was _UNK_ a.m. in New York , and Mr. Smith _UNK_ a call from a New York customer _UNK_ an opinion on the British stock market , which had been having troubles of its own even before Friday `s New York market break .
`` _UNK_ dangerous ... , `` Mr. Smith said , almost in a _UNK_ , `` ... . fundamentally weak ... fairly vulnerable still ... extremely _UNK_ poised ...
we `re in for a lot of turbulence ... . ``
He was right .
By midday , the London market was in full retreat .
`` It `s falling like a _UNK_ , `` said _UNK_ _UNK_ , a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange .
Only half the usual _UNK_ crowd gathered at the tony _UNK_ & _UNK_ wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby .
_UNK_ was _UNK_ as most _UNK_ watched the latest market statistics on television .
At _UNK_ p.m. , the index hit its low , _UNK_ , off _UNK_ points .
`` France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could _UNK_ the index , which you could n`t , `` Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said early in the afternoon .
`` Spain is down 10 % and suspended , Sweden `s down 8 % , Norway 11 % .
This market has been very badly damaged . ``
As _UNK_ p.m. -- Wall Street `s opening time -- _UNK_ , Shearson traders and salesmen traded _UNK_ on how low the New York market would open .
In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger _UNK_ and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- _UNK_ more than 60 points in the first few minutes .
They saw an opportunity created by the sell-off .
As Wall Street traders dumped American _UNK_ _UNK_ in Jaguar PLC , Mr. _UNK_ and trader Sam _UNK_ bought them to _UNK_ in the _UNK_ .
Investors here still expect Ford Motor Co. or General Motors Corp. to bid for Jaguar .
_UNK_ , after about 45 minutes , the U.S. markets rallied .
`` The _UNK_ has gone better , `` _UNK_ one trader at about _UNK_ London time , as the U.S. Major Markets Index contract suddenly indicated a _UNK_ .
As Wall Street strengthened , the London trading room went wild .
Traders _UNK_ as their screens posted an _UNK_ loss on Wall Street .
Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day .
`` Rally ! Rally ! Rally ! `` _UNK_ Shearson trader _UNK_ Rosen , selling more Jaguar shares .
`` This is panic buying ! ``
As the London market rallied , some _UNK_ whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it .
The London index closed at _UNK_ , its high for the day , off _UNK_ , or about 3.3 % .
Ambassador Paul _UNK_ `s statement -LRB- _UNK_ & _UNK_ , Sept. 20 -RRB- , `` If you have a million people working for you , every bad thing that has one chance in a million of going wrong will go wrong at least once a year , `` is a pretty negative way of looking at things .
Is n`t it just as fair to say that if you have a million people working for you , every good thing that has one chance in a million of going right will go right at least once a year ?
Do n`t be such a _UNK_ , Mr. Ambassador .

The House Aviation Subcommittee approved a bill that would give the transportation secretary authority to review and approve leveraged buy-outs of major U.S. airlines .
The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines , spurred quick action on the legislation , introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday .
The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public _UNK_ and Transportation Committee tomorrow , and a floor vote by next week will be urged .
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a _UNK_ shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines .
In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James _UNK_ -LRB- D. , Minn. -RRB- , Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an _UNK_ effort to _UNK_ his bid for AMR , and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , deputy transportation secretary , also sent a letter to express the administration `s opposition to the bill `` in its present form . ``
Rep. _UNK_ _UNK_ off Mr. Trump `s allegations as an `` excuse for his own deal failing . ``
He also said the fact that the other letter had n`t come from Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner indicated there is `` _UNK_ room `` in the administration `s position .
Mr. _UNK_ and other committee members repeatedly stressed that the legislation was n`t a response to any particular market situation .
But they cited the UAL and AMR _UNK_ as reasons to move quickly to enact this legislation .
_UNK_ both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n`t likely to _UNK_ efforts to push the legislation .
`` It `s still on the fast track and we still want to do it , `` said one Senate aide .
The bill is aimed at addressing the concern that an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures to pay off the debt incurred in a leveraged buy-out .
Currently , the transportation secretary does n`t have clearly established authority to block mergers , but can take the _UNK_ step of _UNK_ the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers _UNK_ .
_UNK_ of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and _UNK_ to the _UNK_ process , and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry .
In general , the bill would give the Transportation Department a 30-day review period before 15 % or more of the voting stock of a major U.S. air carrier could be acquired .
It also would require the acquiring party to notify the transportation secretary and to provide all information relevant to determining the intent of the acquisition .
The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information has n`t been provided , or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially , result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets , or give control to a foreign interest .
If more information is needed , the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days .
All the witnesses , both _UNK_ and industry experts , expressed support for the bill in order to prevent _UNK_ from _UNK_ in on airline profits at the expense of safe , _UNK_ service .
But several committee members _UNK_ , some backing Mr. Trump `s claim that the threat of regulation caused the failure of the UAL deal and the stock-market plunge .
One of the major concerns expressed by the _UNK_ was that large airlines would be prohibited from _UNK_ themselves of smaller entities and producing independent _UNK_ companies .
In a possible prelude to the _UNK_ of talks between Boeing Co. and striking Machinists union members , a federal mediator said representatives of the two sides will meet with him tomorrow .
`` It could be a long meeting or it could be a short one , `` said Doug _UNK_ , the mediator , who called the agreement to meet a first step toward a _UNK_ of negotiations .
`` We `re encouraged that talks are scheduled again but beyond that , we have made no expression of expectations , `` a Boeing spokesman said .
The Machinists union has rejected a three-year contract offer that would have provided a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus some bonuses .
Currently , average pay for machinists is $ _UNK_ an hour , Boeing said .
Now in its 13th day , the strike has _UNK_ about 55,000 machinists and has started to delay delivery of some _UNK_ .
With a strike fund of about $ 100 million , the union had said it was prepared for a long strike .
After the third week on strike , union members will begin receiving $ 100 a week from the fund .
_UNK_ at Boeing continues with supervisors and other _UNK_ personnel _UNK_ the lines .
And at the company `s _UNK_ , _UNK_ , plant , about _UNK_ of the _UNK_ machinists still are working , Boeing said .
Under Kansas _UNK_ laws , contracts can not require workers to be union members .
Boeing has declined to say how many employees are working at its giant _UNK_ , Wash. , plant .
Union officials could n`t be reached for comment .
DPC Acquisition Partners , a hostile suitor for Dataproducts Corp. , said it intends to launch a tender offer for the computer printer maker `s common stock .
DPC , a group led by the New York investment firm _UNK_ Inc. , also said it plans to file preliminary materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding a shareholder solicitation to oust Dataproducts ` board .
DPC holds a 7.8 % stake in Dataproducts and made a $ _UNK_ bid for the company in May , but Dataproducts management considered the $ _UNK_ million proposal _UNK_ .
A DPC spokesman declined to elaborate on the group `s new plan .
In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Dataproducts shares jumped 62.5 cents to close at $ _UNK_ .
Dataproducts , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block .
The company `s restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary .
As part of the plan , Dataproducts announced a pact to sell $ 63 million of its real estate holdings to _UNK_ _UNK_ Inc. , a unit of Canada `s _UNK_ Corp .
Jack Davis , Dataproducts ` president , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company `` is at a loss to understand DPC `s intentions . ``
He called today `s announcement `` _UNK_ and _UNK_ `` and said the company intends to proceed with its restructuring .
Share prices plummeted across Europe yesterday in response to Friday `s New York sell-off , but some issues staged a late comeback after Wall Street opened without another _UNK_ .
European investors have further reason for optimism today , after the U.S. rebound .
The Frankfurt Stock Exchange , which closed before the New York exchanges opened , was the hardest hit of the major European markets , with the DAX Index dropping _UNK_ % .
In London , prices plummeted in early trading and were off as much as 9 % before coming back strong after the New York opening to close down only 3.2 % .
West German Economics Minister Helmut _UNK_ said , `` In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly .
There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they are n`t based on fundamentals .
The economy of West Germany and the EC -LCB- European Community -RCB- is highly stable . ``
Paris , which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks , also was hard hit .
Share prices fell in Milan , Amsterdam , Zurich , Madrid and Stockholm .
Prices in Brussels , where a computer breakdown disrupted trading , also tumbled .
Following is a breakdown of major market activity :
_UNK_ :
One of the _UNK_ declines came in the financial center of Europe `s strongest economy .
The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged _UNK_ % , a one-day record , _UNK_ out the summer `s gains .
The index closed at _UNK_ , down _UNK_ points .
By comparison , two years ago on Black Monday , the new index would have dropped 9.4 % , according to a projection by the exchange .
Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday `s U.S. stock market loss because they had _UNK_ memories of the Frankfurt exchange `s losing 35 % of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake .
This time , however , many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly .
`` They all went in the wrong direction , `` said Andreas _UNK_ , an investment adviser for the Bank in _UNK_ `s Frankfurt branch .
He said he told clients to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about 10 % .
After the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders , Frankfurt `s normal _UNK_ trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume .
`` The beginning was _UNK_ , `` said Nigel _UNK_ , a broker for _UNK_ AG .
`` It took _UNK_ of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market . ``
Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices .
`` Everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors .
That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors , `` said _UNK_ _UNK_ , a senior trader for _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up _UNK_ shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting .
But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of _UNK_ on Sept. 8 .
Some of West Germany `s _UNK_ chips took some of the biggest hits .
A _UNK_ % drop for _UNK_ AG and Dresdner Bank AG `s 9.6 % decline were especially _UNK_ for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in _UNK_ .
Dresdner Bank last month said it hoped to raise 1.2 billion marks -LRB- $ _UNK_ million -RRB- by issuing four million shares at 300 marks each .
Yet yesterday `s market _UNK_ Dresdner `s share price by 33 marks to _UNK_ marks a share , leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market _UNK_ quickly .
LONDON :
_UNK_ toward a record drop at midday , the London stock market _UNK_ two-thirds of its losses in the wake of New York `s early rally .
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index closed off _UNK_ points , at _UNK_ , its high for the day , after having plunged _UNK_ points at _UNK_ p.m .
It was big institutions such as _UNK_ Union Insurance Group , Scottish _UNK_ Investment Managers and Standard Life _UNK_ Co. that _UNK_ the rally .
_UNK_ by low prices and encouraged by New York `s performance , they _UNK_ up equities across the board .
Volume was _UNK_ million shares , more than triple recent levels .
_UNK_ :
Late buying gave the Paris _UNK_ a _UNK_ after its free fall early in the day .
The _UNK_ General Index ended down 5.4 % at _UNK_ , a drop of _UNK_ points from Friday .
`` There was a volatility in the market that I have never seen before , `` said _UNK_ _UNK_ , a partner in brokerage firm _UNK_ _UNK_ .
`` When Wall Street turned around shortly after the opening , there was panic buying in Paris . ``
Brokers said that as the news spread that Wall Street was moving up , traders who had called to place sell orders changed their line in _UNK_ , ordering buys instead .
Trading was driven primarily by small investors and speculators , with large institutions waiting on the sidelines until late in the day .
When Wall Street turned , however , the big boys entered the market , looking for bargains .
J.P. Morgan & Co. _UNK_ to a loss in the third quarter , while _UNK_ Corp. reported net income more than doubled , and Security Pacific Corp. net rose 10 % .
J.P. Morgan & Co .
J.P. Morgan , as expected , posted a $ 1.82 billion net loss for the quarter , reflecting the New York bank `s decision last month to add $ 2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries .
The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. among a few major U.S. banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves .
The latest quarter `s loss _UNK_ $ _UNK_ a share .
In the year-earlier quarter , Morgan earned $ _UNK_ million , or $ 1.25 a share .
George M. _UNK_ , analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , called the results `` mildly disappointing . ``
Excluding the $ 2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr. _UNK_ said .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Morgan climbed $ 1.50 a share to $ _UNK_ .
Net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ _UNK_ million from $ _UNK_ million .
The interest rate on short-term funds , which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers , was `` sharply higher , `` Morgan said .
Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been _UNK_ interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said .
Such loans to _UNK_ also remain classified as _UNK_ , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period .
Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ _UNK_ million , reflecting higher _UNK_ and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities .
`` These increases were partly offset by lower _UNK_ `` income , the bank said .
_UNK_ expenses grew 16 % to $ _UNK_ million .
_UNK_ Corp .
_UNK_ Corp. `s net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank `s Texas operations .
The Charlotte , N.C. , company said earnings rose to $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , from $ _UNK_ million , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier .
The latest quarter included a gain of $ _UNK_ million , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of _UNK_ Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
The strong performance , however , _UNK_ with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of _UNK_ `s problem loans , particularly in the Southeast .
In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ _UNK_ million , or _UNK_ % of net loans and leases , from $ _UNK_ million , or _UNK_ % in the second quarter .
_UNK_ totaled $ _UNK_ million , or 1.27 % in the year-ago third quarter .
_UNK_ in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ 33 million loan , which _UNK_ said it `` expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter . ``
The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in _UNK_ `s Southeast operations , as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign .
The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze _UNK_ `s net interest margin in the Southeast to _UNK_ % from _UNK_ % a year earlier .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday , _UNK_ jumped $ _UNK_ a share , to $ 51 .
Results were released after the market closed .
_UNK_ Texas National , formed from the _UNK_ of of the failed First _UNK_ Corp. of Dallas , contributed $ _UNK_ million to _UNK_ `s bottom line in the third quarter .
_UNK_ said its third-quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug. 1 .
_UNK_ raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the _UNK_ Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise .
Last week , the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ _UNK_ million .
In the first nine months , _UNK_ `s net income climbed 65 % to $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , from $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , a year earlier .
Security Pacific Corp .
Security Pacific `s earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans .
Net rose to $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , from $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , a year earlier .
The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans .
These _UNK_ loans in effect replaced some _UNK_ assets such as _UNK_ loans , which were allowed to decrease .
As a result , Security Pacific `s net interest margin fell only 13 basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings .
Security Pacific shares closed at $ _UNK_ , down 37.5 cents , in Big Board composite trading .
The earnings represent a _UNK_ % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an _UNK_ % return on equity .
The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market .
Security Pacific reported a 33 % increase in net credit losses for the quarter , to $ 109 million from $ _UNK_ million in the year-ago period .
_UNK_ loans grew slightly to $ 1.75 billion at Sept. 30 , from $ 1.7 billion a year ago .
Security Pacific `s loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ _UNK_ million , because it added to its _UNK_ reserve the year before .
_UNK_ income fell 6 % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations .
_UNK_ expense grew only 4 % in the period .
For the nine months , net rose 17 % to $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , from $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , a year earlier .
LIN Broadcasting Corp. said it wo n`t take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to buy LIN and has asked for _UNK_ of the offer .
The new offer , which seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares .
McCaw `s revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN .
LIN is asking McCaw to _UNK_ its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their _UNK_ businesses .
BellSouth has notified LIN that it would `` shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is _UNK_ . ``
The LIN board said holders may be _UNK_ by the provision in the McCaw proposal that `` guarantees `` private market value after five years for the remaining shares .
McCaw has `` no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , `` the LIN board said .
The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN `s operations and could , `` therefore , operate LIN in a manner which could _UNK_ its private market value and _UNK_ to a _UNK_ _UNK_ in five years . ``
In national over-the-counter trading , LIN closed at $ _UNK_ , down $ 2.75 .
A group of institutional investors in Telerate Inc. said that Dow Jones & Co. `s $ _UNK_ offer for the electronic financial information services company is `` grossly inadequate . ``
In a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the group , which holds about 4.5 million Telerate shares , or about 4.7 % of the shares outstanding , said `` ... at present none of us believes an offer for less than $ 25 per share would be fair and some believe that $ 25 is too low . ``
The letter was dated Oct. 6 .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Telerate shares closed yesterday at $ _UNK_ , down 75 cents a share .
Dow Jones , publisher of The Wall Street Journal , has launched an $ _UNK_ , or $ _UNK_ million , tender offer to acquire the remaining Telerate shares outstanding ; Dow Jones owns 67 % of Telerate .
Telerate has rejected the offer , which expires Nov. 3 .
The group includes _UNK_ Cos. and various affiliates based in Boston ; Wells Fargo Bank , San Francisco ; the California Public Employees Retirement System , Sacramento , Calif. , and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. , Baltimore .
Among other issues , the group `s letter said it has `` concerns as to whether Dow Jones `s offer meets the applicable requirements of procedural fairness . ``
A spokesman for Dow Jones said he had n`t seen the group `s filing , but added , `` obviously Dow Jones _UNK_ with their _UNK_ .
Our offer is to buy any and all shares tendered at $ 18 a share .
U.S. Trade _UNK_ _UNK_ Hills said the first _UNK_ panel set up under the _UNK_ `` free trade `` agreement has ruled that Canada `s restrictions on exports of Pacific _UNK_ and _UNK_ violate the accord .
Mrs. Hills said the U.S. and Canada have until Nov. 13 to resolve the dispute .
If a solution is n`t reached by then , she said , the U.S. would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S. _UNK_ companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .
However , in _UNK_ , Canadian Trade Minister John _UNK_ said the _UNK_ panel accepted the `` _UNK_ of Canada `s position on the use of these landing requirements to _UNK_ and manage these important _UNK_ . ``
_UNK_ about the _UNK_ _UNK_ in the U.S. and Canadian government views of the panel `s report , an aide for Mrs. Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal . ``
The U.S. trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions .
Canada initially had an export _UNK_ that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought _UNK_ in British Columbia by commercial _UNK_ prior to export .
This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds .
Mrs. Hills said yesterday that the _UNK_ panel rejected this Canadian government argument .
`` We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel `s ruling `` that the `` landing requirement `` also must be ended , she said .
Earlier , an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on _UNK_ and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian _UNK_ restrictions violated GATT rules .
Mrs. Hills said the U.S. wo n`t accept any delays after Nov. 13 because U.S. _UNK_ firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season `s catch .
She said the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded .

_UNK_ Corp. said it completed a restructuring agreement previously agreed to by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , creditor banks and subordinated _UNK_ holders .
The plan would permit the bank holding company to retire its bank and _UNK_ obligations through exchanges of cash and equity .
The FDIC , which in 1986 provided $ 130 million in _UNK_ assistance to _UNK_ `s Bank of Oklahoma , _UNK_ , unit will continue to maintain $ 90 million in preferred stock in the _UNK_ bank unit .
In exchange for the other $ 40 million , the FDIC will receive additional warrants _UNK_ it to buy 60 % of _UNK_ `s common stock outstanding , up from the 55 % option the FDIC received under terms of the 1986 capital _UNK_ .
In exchange for the $ 76 million they are owed , creditor banks will receive 3.9 million shares of _UNK_ common stock and the proceeds from the future sales of four subsidiary banks to private buyers , the bank holding company said .
Also under the agreement , _UNK_ holders will get one million shares of common stock in exchange for $ 7.7 million in debentures and holders of _UNK_ `s series A preferred stock will receive 1.25 shares of common stock for every share of preferred they own , the company said .

_UNK_ Corp. said it will begin an offer tomorrow to exchange up to one million of its common shares and all of its $ _UNK_ million in 7 3__4 % convertible debentures due 2001 for a package of new debt and common stock warrants .

_UNK_ currently has 4.6 million common shares outstanding .
_UNK_ also is offering $ 850 face amount of new notes and 64 _UNK_ warrants for each $ 1,000 face amount of its convertible debt outstanding .
The company said it can redeem the warrants at its option for $ 1 each .
The offer is n`t _UNK_ on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged .
_UNK_ said it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value .
If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer , _UNK_ will increase its debt by $ 9 million , but it also will recognize a $ 2 million gain from retiring the old debt , said Michael J. Blumenfeld , president .
`` We have sufficient cash flow to handle that , `` he said .
The offers are scheduled to expire in _UNK_ to late November .

The market upheaval apparently has n`t triggered any cash crunch -- yet .
Individual investors , investment firms and arbitragers who speculate in the stocks of takeover candidates can suffer liquidity and payment problems when stocks dive ; those investors often borrow heavily to buy their holdings and use the stocks as collateral for loans .
But several large banks said yesterday they detected no signs of unusual demand for credit that would signal such difficulties .
`` We `re seeing nothing out of the ordinary , `` said one official at a _UNK_ 10 bank .
`` That `s good news , because we all _UNK_ in this water . ``
_UNK_ another executive at a big bank : `` We were all a little _UNK_ over the weekend trying to forecast what would happen -LCB- Monday -RCB- , but it `s been very quiet .
Now , as for tomorrow , hell , who knows ?
What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently _UNK_ to handle another _UNK_ in prices .
No _UNK_ with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be _UNK_ to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose .
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours .
The _UNK_ is that an _UNK_ of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .
It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .
A temporary _UNK_ of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from _UNK_ on itself .
But there is also the possibility that _UNK_ down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
What happened Friday was the worst of all _UNK_ .
The futures exchanges followed their own _UNK_ circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor `s 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index .
Options markets stopped trading in many securities .
The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open .
With _UNK_ else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange .
As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .
Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense .
At _UNK_ , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened .
Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at _UNK_ , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines .
At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange .
It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though _UNK_ separate , have actually become so closely _UNK_ as to constitute one market effectively .
Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .
To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none .
_UNK_ circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for _UNK_ , less volatile executions .
It `s time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for _UNK_ trading or staying open .
Let `s not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a _UNK_ decline .
The need for _UNK_ last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that _UNK_ circuit breakers in all markets .
The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open .
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies .
Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission -LRB- which , with the SEC , _UNK_ the Chicago stock-index markets -RRB- be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .

Yesterday was , in the words of New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. , just your `` reasonably normal , 400 _UNK_ , up _UNK_ day . ``
When it was all over and stocks had staged a huge recovery , Big Board officials were _UNK_ about how well the day had gone .
They said the exchange `s trading procedures , personnel , equipment and links with other exchanges could n`t have performed better .
`` We had no operating problems at all , `` Mr. Phelan said after the market closed .
`` All the things that we set up to slow down the process , to let people know that the market was in an extreme position , worked extremely well . ``
Prices for the _UNK_ million shares that changed hands during the session were carried on the exchange `s trading tape with barely a delay , officials said .
While reaching _UNK_ _UNK_ yesterday , the volume was still well within the 600 _UNK_ capacity that the exchange has said it can handle daily since _UNK_ up its computers after the October 1987 crash .
The so-called circuit breakers devised by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to _UNK_ free falls in stock and futures prices were n`t triggered yesterday because the markets were higher for most of the day .
Despite traders ` complaints , Mr. Phelan said the links with the Chicago futures market worked as planned in Friday `s _UNK_ to provide a _UNK_ period .
Of greater help , the Big Board chairman said , was the `` natural circuit _UNK_ `` of the weekend , that provided a breathing period that `` brought _UNK_ back to the market .
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ By _UNK_ of _UNK_
_UNK_ _UNK_ chains , faced with a worsening business slump , are struggling to _UNK_ some new marketing strategies .
The _UNK_ Report , which tracks consumer purchases , says customer traffic at _UNK_ restaurants fell 10 % in the second quarter , while the overall fast-food customer count was down 2 % .
_UNK_ business is off largely because of more competition from _UNK_ convenience food , _UNK_ _UNK_ and other _UNK_ fare , says a spokesman for the report , a publication of _UNK_ Group , a market research firm in Port Washington , N.Y .
The loss of more customers is the latest in a string of problems .
Church `s Fried _UNK_ Inc. and _UNK_ `s _UNK_ Fried _UNK_ Inc. , which have merged , are still troubled by _UNK_ restaurant locations .
_UNK_ chains also are feeling more pressure from McDonald `s Corp. , which introduced its _UNK_ _UNK_ this year and recently tested the sale of individual pieces of _UNK_ .
New management at Kentucky Fried _UNK_ , a unit of PepsiCo Inc. , has fought back with new medium and large _UNK_ _UNK_ for the lunch crowd .
And the chain is testing products that are n`t _UNK_ , such as `` _UNK_ `` _UNK_ , to try to win _UNK_ consumers .
Kentucky Fried _UNK_ also is testing _UNK_ of _UNK_ , which could be a hit with _UNK_ _UNK_ .
But some fast-food industry analysts say problems with keeping _UNK_ warm and fresh must be solved first .
A Kentucky Fried _UNK_ spokesman , however , disputed the notion that the delivery service experienced problems in some markets where testing has been discontinued .
He says the test is continuing in Chicago , Columbus , Ohio , and a few other cities .

His _UNK_ : _UNK_ radio spots that offer helpful _UNK_ .
The only plug for the sponsor is a brief mention at the end of the spot .
The messages resemble the Business _UNK_ , a daily _UNK_ of travel tips developed by Mr. Bear and sponsored by travel agencies in several major cities .
New _UNK_ include Burt Hill _UNK_ _UNK_ Associates , a _UNK_ , Pa. , _UNK_ firm .
Its radio series features such spots as `` _UNK_ : _UNK_ _UNK_ for Urban _UNK_ `` and `` Building a _UNK_ to Park . ``
A harder sell , says John _UNK_ , the firm `s president , would `` _UNK_ from the profession . ``
_UNK_ have signed up to use the messages to promote _UNK_ , and _UNK_ Gas Co. is considering the _UNK_ to offer energy tips to consumers .
But such spots can be too soft .
`` There `s always a risk of lost messages , `` says John _UNK_ , chairman of _UNK_ Advertising USA , which created similar radio spots for Pittsburgh National Bank .
`` It `s a question of how much credibility you gain for the possible loss of recognition . ``
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ In Environmental _UNK_
_UNK_ `S a retailer that `s getting tough in the push for environmentally safe packaging and products .
Big Bear _UNK_ Inc. , a grocery chain based in San Diego , plans to display shelf cards and distribute _UNK_ recommending products deemed safe for the environment .
The choices will be based on research by the San Diego Environmental Health _UNK_ and will include products like Murphy `s Oil _UNK_ and other _UNK_ _UNK_ .
But the chain is quickly _UNK_ the _UNK_ of such _UNK_ .
For example , it recommends _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ and puts _UNK_ on its environmentally safe list .
That does n`t _UNK_ Procter & Gamble Co. , maker of _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ .
A company spokesman questioned the _UNK_ of the list , noting that _UNK_ is present in all major _UNK_ _UNK_ .
In fact , _UNK_ Bros. confirms that its _UNK_ brand does contain _UNK_ _UNK_ , even though it is n`t listed on the label for the _UNK_ version .
Thomas G. _UNK_ , Big Bear `s executive vice president , said the chain is still reviewing its product list to avoid such problems .
`` Our intent is to promote the best alternative , `` he says .
`` And it `s important that we be accurate . ``
But in the end , customers ` wishes are what will prevail .
Big Bear does n`t care for disposable _UNK_ , which are n`t _UNK_ .
Yet parents demand them .
Says Mr. _UNK_ , `` We `ll still be forced to sell items we might not _UNK_ agree with . ``

She has also served on several task forces on acquired immune deficiency syndrome .

The newsletter Medicine & Health , which first disclosed her selection by Dr. Sullivan , said she is 44 years old and she studied at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine .
The continuing series of HUD scandals is a _UNK_ predictable result of pork-barrel politics .
Nevertheless , _UNK_ such as the National Association of Home _UNK_ -LRB- _UNK_ -RRB- continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more special-interest spending .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a _UNK_ housing crisis -- reduced _UNK_ of homes for _UNK_ buyers , increased _UNK_ , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult `` to solve `` without expanded federal resources . ``
There `s nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending .
But the _UNK_ was created in _UNK_ out of an organization that made its name fighting a _UNK_ administration proposal to take over all defense housing production .
Through the years the association has been an active member of the taxpayer `s coalition , pushing for such initiatives as the _UNK_ amendment .
Yet on matters close to , _UNK_ , home ...
`` The HUD budget has dropped by more than 70 % since 1980 , `` argues Mr. _UNK_ .
`` We `ve taken more than our fair share .
I would n`t have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . ``
But _UNK_ support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the _UNK_ has backed a host of public programs .
It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced _UNK_ housing measures .
Moreover , explains one HUD official , the _UNK_ remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that _UNK_ in subsidized production .
The association is pushing an extensive and expensive _UNK_ , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually .
It would like to _UNK_ the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the median price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ _UNK_ ; reduce -LRB- or even eliminate -RRB- FHA _UNK_ requirements and increase the availability of _UNK_ mortgages ; expand the _UNK_ Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate `` funding for the Farmers Home Administration -LRB- _UNK_ -RRB- ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and _UNK_ ; and `` fully fund `` the _UNK_ Act , a $ _UNK_ million _UNK_ for the homeless .
Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved _UNK_ expensive in the past , and inevitably are _UNK_ to the benefit of _UNK_ developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or _UNK_ .
_UNK_ subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better .
Though Mr. _UNK_ says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , `` the mere _UNK_ of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- to the single-family home market would result in a major expense .
More important , housing programs run by HUD , the _UNK_ , and _UNK_ are _UNK_ in red ink .
The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government `s equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion .
The federal government has had to pump in $ _UNK_ billion into the _UNK_ housing program since 1984 to keep the fund _UNK_ and the _UNK_ requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended .
All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgages .
In its _UNK_ produced publication `` Where Will Our _UNK_ _UNK_ ? `` the _UNK_ does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing _UNK_ can not be provided by the federal government . ``
It points to the _UNK_ impact of local government regulation , particularly _UNK_ and building fees , which _UNK_ the price of housing out of the reach of _UNK_ and _UNK_ people .
But while the _UNK_ has suggested actions that states and _UNK_ should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate _UNK_ controls .
The association , a majority of whose _UNK_ members build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ of the National _UNK_ Union : `` It _UNK_ in two _UNK_ .
The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the _UNK_ amendment . ``
Unfortunately , the organization `s desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility .
Two years ago when the _UNK_ _UNK_ for the $ 19 billion omnibus housing bill , the organization `` basically dropped out of the taxpayers ` coalition , `` says Ms. _UNK_ .
As Mr. _UNK_ of the _UNK_ acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... .
The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . ``
More money for HUD will increase the deficit and _UNK_ the economy ; more money to _UNK_ that are _UNK_ their local housing markets will further _UNK_ them from the _UNK_ effects of their policies .
Is this what the home builders want ?

In an attempt to give new momentum to European Community plans for a single currency , EC government leaders are likely to agree to set a date for starting formal talks on _UNK_ the EC `s founding Treaty of Rome .
According to diplomatic sources in Brussels , most EC leaders agree that talks should begin in the second half of 1990 , and will make a declaration on that during a summit meeting in _UNK_ , France , on Dec. 8 and 9 .
The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , who is opposed to creating a single EC currency .
But the process of _UNK_ the _UNK_ conference does n`t require _UNK_ .
_UNK_ a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push .
French President _UNK_ Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June , but the move was _UNK_ because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
_UNK_ sources said Mr. Kohl may now agree to set a date for the conference to make it clear that West Germany is still committed to EC unity .
The latest _UNK_ in the equities markets _UNK_ me of the joke T. _UNK_ _UNK_ tells about the guy who was run over by the _UNK_ .
When asked `` What went wrong ? `` the unfortunate victim replied , `` It was a combination of things . ``
And so it was on Gray Friday .
The grand _UNK_ of this _UNK_ would appear to have been excess leverage .
Even if that is so , however , it `s probably the case that no barriers should have been _UNK_ to stop the _UNK_ before the end of the _UNK_ -LRB- _UNK_ -RRB- .
The _UNK_ began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was _UNK_ .
Although the _UNK_ expects to _UNK_ together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the _UNK_ of _UNK_ takeover deals is ending .
_UNK_ of other _UNK_ made up the _UNK_ , of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices , _UNK_ Federal Reserve _UNK_ ; and the Bush administration `s -LRB- temporary ? -RRB- defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax .
As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that _UNK_ _UNK_ band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write .
What really _UNK_ the _UNK_ along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is _UNK_ up .
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly _UNK_ investments in the `` deal `` stocks are _UNK_ by the unexpected _UNK_ up of the _UNK_ for deal financing .
Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses .
UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ _UNK_ , down about 20 % from Thursday `s close .
AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday `s close .
-LRB- Both took further hits yesterday . -RRB-
Hilton lost 20 % on Friday ; Paramount lost almost 11 % .
A careful look _UNK_ that where deal financing has been secured , the target `s stock price was not affected on Friday .
The _UNK_ prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks _UNK_ issue billions in high-yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated .
The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday `s dramatic march for several weeks .
The growing financial difficulties of recent _UNK_ _UNK_ or takeovers , such as _UNK_ International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau `s retailing empire , have cast a _UNK_ over the entire market for high-yield securities .
Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio _UNK_ and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring .
As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times .
These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the _UNK_ boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we `ve seen is the market _UNK_ them in .
Of course , Washington had n`t been _UNK_ in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to _UNK_ in the leverage _UNK_ remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n`t _UNK_ us from the basic market _UNK_ that was at work on Friday .
If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ?
After all , the stock market `s response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the _UNK_ direction of regulators .
Is this a case where private markets are _UNK_ of Washington `s _UNK_ of Wall Street ?
_UNK_ not .
To the extent that Friday `s sell-off reflected a sudden _UNK_ of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior .
The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged _UNK_ .
The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the _UNK_ of bank capital for recent deals _UNK_ the wisdom of letting the free markets operate .
If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO _UNK_ become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with _UNK_ speed to impose appropriate sanctions .
Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the _UNK_ , but they _UNK_ the _UNK_ up all year .
Not surprisingly , he sometimes _UNK_ .
The arbitragers and takeover _UNK_ got killed on Gray Friday , while the _UNK_ managers of prospective targets _UNK_ _UNK_ .
If you identify with the _UNK_ managers , you must concede that _UNK_ and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington .
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated .
The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics .
Although the average _UNK_ is probably not _UNK_ too much from Washington `s _UNK_ war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial _UNK_ , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm .
Any such attempt to _UNK_ `` good debt `` from `` bad debt , `` or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to _UNK_ the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general .
Far better for policy makers to concentrate on the war against drugs , Panama and the deficit , all of them _UNK_ that seem never to end .

Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising _UNK_ points to close the morning session at _UNK_ .
The index slid _UNK_ points , or 1.8 % , on Monday .
In the first 25 minutes of Tuesday `s trading the Nikkei index soared _UNK_ points , to _UNK_ .
By 10 a.m. Tokyo time , the index was up _UNK_ points , to _UNK_ as investors hailed New York `s overnight rally .
Monday `s slide came in a relatively calm session that did n`t provide much direction for other markets .
Shares also closed sharply lower across Europe , particularly in Frankfurt , although London and a few other markets recovered some ground after stocks began to rebound in New York .
Other Asian and Pacific markets had sharper losses than Tokyo , but the selling wave stopped short of _UNK_ another market crash .
All eyes were on Tokyo at the opening because it was the first major market to trade since Friday `s 190.58-point plunge on Wall Street .
But rather than set the tone for other markets , Japan `s major institutional investors chose to remain on the sidelines .
Still , despite the sudden _UNK_ of stock-market turbulence , managers of Japanese investment funds said they were n`t planning to unload U.S. or European equities .
`` We did n`t trade much today , as our policy now is to wait and see , `` said a fund manager at _UNK_ Life Insurance Co .
`` We would like to wait and see until trading goes around through Europe and New York . ``
The institutions appeared confident that Japanese regulators would step in to ensure _UNK_ trading if necessary , and there was considerable speculation during the day that the Finance Ministry was working behind the scenes to do just that .
But in the absence of _UNK_ trading , its presence was never _UNK_ felt .
At the close , the Nikkei average of 225 stocks stood at _UNK_ , down _UNK_ points , or 1.8 % .
The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index sank _UNK_ , or 1.7 % , to _UNK_ .
The day `s decline was generally in line with analysts ` weekend predictions .
Declining issues _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ .
But volume was thin at _UNK_ million shares , compared with _UNK_ million Friday .
The market opened sharply lower , with the Nikkei average down nearly 600 after 20 minutes .
A _UNK_ rebound brought it back to show a gain of about 200 at the end of the morning session , but the rally failed in the afternoon , and the market closed near the day `s low .
The smaller stocks in the Tokyo market `s second section also posted their biggest decline of the year .
The Tokyo Stock Exchange index for the second section fell _UNK_ , or 2.7 % , to _UNK_ .
Many investors , trying to _UNK_ the market `s major indexes , have _UNK_ to these small issues in recent weeks .
Japanese investors and traders expressed relief that the Tokyo market did n`t fall more sharply .
But its performance did bear some _UNK_ to events of two years ago , during the October 1987 global stock market crash .
On Oct. 16 , 1987 -- the Friday before the Black Monday crash -- the New York market dropped 4.6 % , and Tokyo followed on Monday with a 2.4 % drop .
This time , Wall Street `s plunge of 6.9 % Friday was followed by yesterday `s 1.8 % loss in Tokyo .
Two years ago , Tokyo `s biggest fall came the day after New York `s _UNK_ % Black Monday plunge , when the Nikkei average fell _UNK_ % .
Thus , market participants yesterday were looking ahead _UNK_ to Wall Street `s opening .
But in New York yesterday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged _UNK_ to close at _UNK_ on heavy volume of _UNK_ shares , although declining issues still outnumbered advancing ones on the broad market .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co. , called yesterday `s session `` a good scenario `` for Japan .
`` Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders , `` he said .
`` For us institutional investors , the chance for buying has come . ``
_UNK_ _UNK_ , general manager of the investment research department at _UNK_ Trust & Banking Co. , also was optimistic .
He described Friday `s plunge in the U.S. as a `` _UNK_ `` event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity .
`` Unless there is a panic , this is the best time to buy , as was the case two years ago , `` he said .
`` Those shares which had posted gains on _UNK_ speculation were _UNK_ with cold water , but as far as major stocks are concerned , there is n`t much impact . ``
Other fund managers were similarly _UNK_ .
`` We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities , `` said _UNK_ _UNK_ , chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at _UNK_ Trust & Banking Co .
He said Friday `s Wall Street decline was `` well within the range of volatility `` that _UNK_ Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy .
Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore `s _UNK_ Times Industrial Index down 10 % .
Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong .
_UNK_ , Manila , Seoul , Taipei and _UNK_ escaped with slightly smaller losses .
Brokers and fund managers said the region `s markets were reacting to Friday `s Wall Street plunge even though that decline was due to local factors such as failed corporate buy-outs and a deteriorating junk-bond market .
`` It `s pure psychology , `` said William _UNK_ _UNK_ , an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- _UNK_ -RRB- Ltd. in Hong Kong .
`` Markets in this region are n`t so _UNK_ to leveraged buy-outs , and their economies generally are in good shape , but there `s no doubt that Asia is still following America `s lead . ``
Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows .
Hong Kong is the region `s next most open market , but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China .
`` Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , `` said Elizabeth Hambrecht , a regional analyst with _UNK_ Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd .
She pointed out that even after Monday `s 10 % decline , the _UNK_ Times index is up 24 % this year , so investors who _UNK_ out generally did so _UNK_ .
Similarly , Kuala Lumpur `s composite index yesterday ended _UNK_ % above its 1988 close .
In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng Index fell _UNK_ to finish at _UNK_ .
Trading was heavy at about one billion shares , compared with _UNK_ million Friday .
But the session was _UNK_ , in contrast to the market `s four-day _UNK_ after the 1987 crash .
Richard _UNK_ , a director at Hong _UNK_ _UNK_ International Fund Managers Ltd. , said the market probably has n`t hit bottom yet but is close .
`` If New York does n`t collapse , I see maybe another 5 % on the downside , not counting the risk of bad news out of China , `` he said .
In Australia , Sydney `s All _UNK_ index closed at _UNK_ , down 8.1 % , its biggest drop since October 1987 .
But volume rose only to _UNK_ million shares from _UNK_ million Friday .
_UNK_ _UNK_ , an analyst at brokerage firm _UNK_ , _UNK_ & Young Ltd. , described the market `s performance as `` _UNK_ `` as investors fled to _UNK_ Australian stocks and _UNK_ _UNK_ companies they perceived as having any takeover premium built into the price .
London `s Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of _UNK_ , down _UNK_ , or 3.2 % .
At its low , shortly before Wall Street opened , it was off more than 130 points .
The Financial Times 30-share index closed _UNK_ points lower at _UNK_ .
Volume more than doubled to _UNK_ million shares from _UNK_ million Friday .
Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading .
The decline in the German Stock Index of _UNK_ points , or _UNK_ % , to _UNK_ was the Frankfurt market `s _UNK_ fall ever .
_UNK_ investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as 20 % .
Analysts cited memories of two years ago , when many small investors held on to their shares after the October crash but the West German market continued to decline _UNK_ for the next three months .
Here are price trends on the world `s major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva .

Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you _UNK_ the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California .
We `ve always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California `s _UNK_ , but maybe the state `s _UNK_ _UNK_ are starting to _UNK_ the forces that made it such a significant place .
What else is one to make of the _UNK_ _UNK_ initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state `s attorney general ?
If passed by the voters , the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides , reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40 % , ban new offshore drilling , ban chemicals thought to _UNK_ the ozone layer , and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $ 40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too _UNK_ .
The initiative is based largely on the _UNK_ of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of _UNK_ _UNK_ , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National _UNK_ _UNK_ and the Citizens for a Better _UNK_ .
_UNK_ , the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one .
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed .
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n`t meet the initiative `s standards .
Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market .
In other words , California is _UNK_ to take control of the nation `s farm policy .
As usual the green lobby `s proposal is _UNK_ from scientific reality .
Consider the _UNK_ provision .
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % .
Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory , it is _UNK_ that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is _UNK_ as a global problem .
But if rational science and economics have nothing to do with the new environment initiative , what is going on ?
The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit .
The key here is the _UNK_ of state Attorney General John Van de _UNK_ .
He `s running for governor .
Mr. Van de _UNK_ is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and _UNK_ them into a single _UNK_ initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 .
That `s also the day of the _UNK_ election .
The initiative seems to have been _UNK_ to include all the hot issues that set off the wealthy Hollywood _UNK_ who _UNK_ money .
And it allows Mr. Van de _UNK_ to get around campaign spending limits .
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de _UNK_ initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is _UNK_ .
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big _UNK_ .
-LRB- The Republican candidate , Sen. _UNK_ Wilson , is playing the initiative _UNK_ game too , _UNK_ his own crime initiative . -RRB-
While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course _UNK_ that in modern California it could slide through .
This is the state that recently passed the _UNK_ 65 _UNK_ initiative .
If this new proposal ever does become law , the green lobby will benefit directly .
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n`t like .
That means the _UNK_ and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation ; taxpayers would bear the cost .
Mr. Van de _UNK_ and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a _UNK_ and _UNK_ issue among certain segments of California `s population now that almost any collection of _UNK_ , _UNK_ _UNK_ can pass under its _UNK_ .
Of course the state `s _UNK_ are not yet a nation _UNK_ themselves .
George Bush , for example , may decide that he does n`t want to be the President who lost control of interstate _UNK_ to an attorney general from California .
And some other segments of California `s political and media culture may yet start to point out that the initiative would impose significant costs on the state `s less affluent citizens in the form of higher food prices and lost jobs .
This _UNK_ initiative will help California _UNK_ itself for the future either as a state still _UNK_ to economic and scientific reality , or as one being led to _UNK_ its _UNK_ activists want to take it .
First , there was a death watch .
Then _UNK_ .
_UNK_ by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and _UNK_ about a half of Friday `s 190.58-point plunge , gaining _UNK_ to _UNK_ .
It was the _UNK_ advance for the average of 30 blue chips , on _UNK_ New York Stock Exchange volume of _UNK_ shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash .
While the advance _UNK_ investors who feared a _UNK_ crash would occur yesterday , it was _UNK_ a _UNK_ rally fed by huge buying by _UNK_ institutions and program traders .
A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered _UNK_ , _UNK_ to _UNK_ , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday `s late Big Board plunge .
The Nasdaq OTC index closed down _UNK_ to _UNK_ .
Meanwhile , in a _UNK_ in two of the market `s most important indicators , the Dow industrials ` sister average , the _UNK_ Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled _UNK_ to _UNK_ -- its _UNK_ decline next to the _UNK_ fall during the 1987 crash .
_UNK_ plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon .
UAL , the takeover stock at the center of Friday `s 190.58-point market plunge , fell 56 7__8 to _UNK_ 7__8 on nearly 2.3 million shares .
Overall , `` this is a _UNK_ rally but it `s very selective , `` said Arthur _UNK_ Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board .
`` Everyone was a little concerned about the general _UNK_ of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory .
It `s just a strange feeling .
I do n`t think anyone left the place _UNK_ _UNK_ . ``
The rally gave _UNK_ , at least for now , to the _UNK_ declaration of Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. that Friday `s market debacle was `` an _UNK_ condition , and not a disaster . ``
But to traders , it looked like disaster on the 9:30 a.m. opening bell .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down _UNK_ shortly after 9:30 .
But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average , including Eastman Kodak and General Motors , could n`t trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday `s _UNK_ _UNK_ .
At _UNK_ , Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow _UNK_ of late -- opened down 2 3__4 to _UNK_ .
The Dow dropped to a quick _UNK_ loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .
More stocks opened over the _UNK_ half hour , as the 49 Big Board specialist firms in charge of keeping the market _UNK_ _UNK_ to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood .
Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , _UNK_ stocks into _UNK_ losses .
There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets .
This was a _UNK_ from Friday , when Standard & Poor `s 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks .
The _UNK_ of the program selling _UNK_ any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized .
They did n`t .
The Dow _UNK_ its slide , losing _UNK_ in the first 40 minutes of trading .
With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .
Then at _UNK_ the Dow suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the _UNK_ fall .
And this time , it was n`t just the program traders who were responsible .
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .
The program traders were in there , too , of course .
But according to one trader , the _UNK_ `` did n`t look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of _UNK_ `` by institutions .
_UNK_ M. _UNK_ , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which oversees $ 29 billion in investments , said the `` first thing we did was to double our orders `` yesterday morning .
`` With the market down like this , we `ll probably take another $ 50 million and put it in `` the market .
Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ` eyes .
According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest _UNK_ imbalances on Friday ; it was one of the seven stocks that could n`t finish trading that day .
The stock opened late at 114 1__2 , down 8 1__2 .
But then it shot upward 7 1__2 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought , traders said .
However , Disney specialist Robert _UNK_ said : `` I would be surprised if Goldman represented 4 % of the opening volume . ``
_UNK_ Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday `s gridlock .
At Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. , head equity trader _UNK_ _UNK_ said : `` I think the opening was _UNK_ .
It was _UNK_ .
We put some orders together .
There was n`t a lot of panic selling , either _UNK_ or internationally ... .
Not like Friday where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart . ``
Still , the market had n`t yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were _UNK_ .
But in another dramatic burst , the Dow _UNK_ on 42 points in five minutes , and at _UNK_ the index showed a gain of _UNK_ .
On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders _UNK_ their approval .
_UNK_ _UNK_ Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. `s OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . ``
_UNK_ him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of _UNK_ water to cool them off .
Among Big Board specialists , the _UNK_ was `` _UNK_ your offers `` -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares .
`` It was _UNK_ on the upside , `` said one Big Board specialist .
But not everybody was making money .
The _UNK_ on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation `s major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday .
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses .
Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning .
`` They were absolutely killed , _UNK_ , `` said one Chicago-based options trader .
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose 20 stocks _UNK_ the Dow industrials , did n`t lead yesterday `s big rally .
James _UNK_ , a partner at specialist _UNK_ & _UNK_ , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago `` -- `` _UNK_ Tuesday , `` Oct. 20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a _UNK_ to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million and get the program rally started .
This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away .
Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a _UNK_ . ``
However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of _UNK_ Tuesday .
`` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , `` said Donald _UNK_ , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc .
Although the Big Board `s specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance yesterday was better than during Friday `s _UNK_ chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them .
_UNK_ were criticized for their inability to maintain _UNK_ markets during the Friday plunge .
But yesterday , even with _UNK_ in such major blue-chip stocks as Merck , `` we expected -LRB- the _UNK_ -RRB- and it was n`t too bad , `` said Donaldson `s Mr. _UNK_ , who had been critical of the specialists ` performance on Friday .
According to a Big Board official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading _UNK_ in only three issues -- AMR , Merck and _UNK_ Energy .
Merck is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index .
No sector of the market has been _UNK_ during the past two days ` gyrations .
Yet from the Dow industrials ` high on Oct. 9 through Friday `s plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real-estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks .
And yesterday , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues .
For example , _UNK_ jumped 3 1__4 to 38 , _UNK_ rose 2 1__2 to 43 1__4 and Baker Hughes rose 1 1__8 to 22 .
Because of the UAL and AMR _UNK_ , airlines were the weakest sector of the market yesterday .
Philip Morris was the Big Board `s most active issue , rising 2 1__4 to 43 1__4 on nearly eight million shares .
Among other major issues , Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3__4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1__4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares .
Shares of International Business Machines , which reported earnings yesterday , finished at 103 , up 1 , after slipping below 100 during Friday `s session for the first time in five years .
Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings .
Merrill Lynch added 1 3__4 to 28 , PaineWebber rose 3__4 to 18 1__2 and Bear Stearns rose 3__8 to 14 1__4 .
Federal National Mortgage Association , a recently hot stock , climbed 4 to _UNK_ on nearly 1.6 million shares .
At a news conference after the close of trading yesterday , the Big Board `s Mr. Phelan and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel .
Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n`t responsible for _UNK_ Friday `s decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months .
Some 24 million of the more than 100 million shares traded in the final 90 minutes of Friday `s session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were _UNK_ , he said .
Program trades make up 10 % of the exchange `s volume on an average day , but despite the increase Friday , it was `` certainly not something you would say _UNK_ the market decline , `` Mr. Phelan said .
Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday .
`` Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it `s going to make everybody nervous , including me , `` he said .
He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout the weekend and that `` all the participants _UNK_ very , very _UNK_ today . ``
Meanwhile , Peter DaPuzzo , Shearson `s head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq `s biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors .
`` The institutions ca n`t be criticized for their behavior , `` Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview .
`` It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19 .
They used their judgment .
They did n`t panic during the first round of selling this morning .
Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market _UNK_ .
Maybe they learned from experience . ``
Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday `s plunge was _UNK_ , because out of _UNK_ Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n`t reopened before the close .
`` They did an excellent job , `` Mr. Phelan said of the specialists .
Wall Street traders on Friday had complained about the trading _UNK_ .

A _UNK_ appeals panel yesterday refused to comply , though liberal Judge _UNK_ _UNK_ went out of her way to deny that this was a `` _UNK_ `` case .
Of course it was .
NASA should now sue for fines against all three _UNK_ , foreign and domestic , for bringing this _UNK_ case .
A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the _UNK_ U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii .
The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less .
The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a _UNK_ _UNK_ for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years .
By a _UNK_ margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights .
But the _UNK_ compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions .
As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast .
Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank _UNK_ -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to _UNK_ votes for the initiative .
The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. _UNK_ `s jurisdiction , and the final compromise is _UNK_ with more than $ _UNK_ million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver .
From the _UNK_ , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow .
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina .
Majority _UNK_ William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban .
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of _UNK_ lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more _UNK_ , but politically important , projects of members .
In a _UNK_ lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor .
`` _UNK_ can vote as they want , `` said Rep. William Lehman -LRB- D. , Fla. -RRB- , head of the House conferees .
`` But if you make a request , you should support the committee . ``
Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ _UNK_ billion -- a 12 % boost .
The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver `s ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental .
_UNK_ of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver .
Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying .
The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the _UNK_ .
But this was rejected in favor of much _UNK_ language _UNK_ the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost about $ 2 billion .
Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ _UNK_ million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports .
The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program , but the list of _UNK_ airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy .
Congress previously cut six airports this year .
The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 for each passenger in subsidies .
Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ _UNK_ million for _UNK_ , including $ 85 million for capital improvements .
And _UNK_ grants for mass _UNK_ would be effectively frozen at $ _UNK_ billion , or $ 20 million more than last fiscal year .

Sony Corp. , which has offered to acquire the _UNK_ company , is seeking to free its top executives , Peter Guber and Jon Peters , from an exclusive agreement with Time Warner Inc. `s Warner Communications Inc. so they can run Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc .
Sony two weeks ago agreed to acquire Columbia for $ 3.4 billion , or $ 27 a share .
Warner sued Sony and Guber-Peters late last week ; Sony and Guber-Peters have _UNK_ , charging Warner with attempting to interfere in Sony `s acquisition of the two companies .
Guber-Peters `s net income in the latest quarter compared with a net loss of $ 6.9 million , or 62 cents a share , in the year-earlier period .
The company said revenue rose _UNK_ % , to $ _UNK_ million from $ 4.6 million , reflecting the success of its movies `` _UNK_ in the _UNK_ `` and `` _UNK_ , `` as well as the _UNK_ _UNK_ `` Batman .
A group including Jon M. _UNK_ of _UNK_ Lake City , said it boosted its stake in _UNK_ Chemical Corp. to _UNK_ % of the the common shares outstanding .

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , the _UNK_ group said it controls _UNK_ _UNK_ common shares , including _UNK_ shares bought from Aug. 21 to Oct. 13 for $ 20 to $ _UNK_ per share .
Officials at _UNK_ , based in Pittsburgh , declined comment .
Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland , so it is getting ready to send its own version of a _UNK_ package .
Last month , the Senate voted to send a delegation of congressional staffers to Poland to assist its legislature , the _UNK_ , in democratic procedures .
Senator _UNK_ _UNK_ calls this effort `` the first gift of democracy . ``
The Poles might do better to view it as a _UNK_ _UNK_ .
It is the vast shadow government of 15,000 congressional staffers that helps create such legislative _UNK_ as the _UNK_ page , _UNK_ reconciliation bill that claimed to be the budget of the United States .
Maybe after the staffers explain their work to the Poles , they `d be willing to come back and do the same for the American people .
_UNK_ _UNK_ PLC , a financially troubled Irish maker of fine _UNK_ and _UNK_ _UNK_ , reported that its pretax loss for the first six months widened to 10.6 million Irish _UNK_ -LRB- $ _UNK_ million -RRB- from 5.8 million Irish _UNK_ a year earlier .
The results for the half were worse than market expectations , which suggested an interim loss of around 10 million Irish _UNK_ .
In a sharply weaker London market yesterday , _UNK_ shares were down 15 pence at 50 pence -LRB- 79 cents -RRB- .
The company reported a loss after taxation and minority interests of 14 million Irish _UNK_ , compared with a loss of _UNK_ million Irish _UNK_ for the year-earlier period .
There were n`t any extraordinary items .
Sales for the total group rose 27 % to _UNK_ million Irish _UNK_ compared with _UNK_ million Irish _UNK_ a year ago .

_UNK_ said the appointment of a new management team and the signing of a comprehensive labor agreement are expected to enhance the company `s long-term prospects .
The sudden `` flight to quality `` that triggered Friday `s _UNK_ _UNK_ rally was reversed yesterday in a `` flight from quality `` _UNK_ .
The setback , in which Treasury bond prices plummeted , reflected a rebound in the stock market and profit-taking .
`` It was a pretty wild day .
Our markets were closely tied to the stock market , `` said Joel _UNK_ , manager of trading at Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co .
`` Friday `s flight to quality was no longer needed once the stock market found its _UNK_ , `` he said .
Some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly _UNK_ drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday .
That caused investors to _UNK_ stocks and buy high-quality Treasury bonds , which are safer than other types of securities .
But when stocks began to climb instead , prices of Treasury bonds declined .
_UNK_ to the selling pressure were _UNK_ by several investment firms advising clients to boost their stock holdings and reduce the size of their cash or bond portfolios .
Among the firms were Merrill Lynch & Co. and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc .
The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to _UNK_ as low as 8 1__2 % .
The closely watched rate on federal funds , or overnight loans between banks , slid to about 8 3__4 % last week , down from its perceived target level of about 9 % .
The rate is considered an early signal of changes in Fed policy .
Traders said yesterday `s modest easing did n`t stir much enthusiasm because it had been widely expected .
In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week .
Others note that some investors were disappointed because they had expected a more aggressive easing .
The Treasury `s benchmark 30-year bond , ended about 1 3__4 points lower , or down about $ 17.50 for each $ 1,000 face amount .
The reversal was even more evident among _UNK_ Treasury securities .
After Treasury bill rates plummeted as much as _UNK_ percentage point on Friday , they gave back _UNK_ of that amount yesterday .
The _UNK_ yield on three-month Treasury bills , for example , was quoted late yesterday at _UNK_ % , compared with _UNK_ % Friday .
_UNK_ corporate bonds , mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds also fell .
But prices of junk bonds , which were battered Friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session .
_UNK_ bonds opened as much as four points lower but staged a modest comeback as stock prices firmed .
Some traders said the high-yield market was helped by active institutional buying .
In particular , they said , firms such as First Boston Corp. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. began making a market in junk issues early in the session when prices hit severely depressed levels .
`` I think the willingness of securities companies to make markets for high-yield issues improved the sentiment for junk bonds , `` said John _UNK_ , an economist at Moody `s Investors Service Inc .
U.S. Treasury bonds were higher in overnight trading in Japan , which opened at about _UNK_ p.m. EDT .
The benchmark 30-year bond , for example rose one point in early Japanese trading in reaction to a quick _UNK_ drop in the Tokyo stock market .
But as Japanese stocks rebounded , Treasurys retreated and ended just modestly higher .
Many U.S. trading operations , _UNK_ to keep a _UNK_ eye on Japanese trading as an indication of where U.S. trading would begin , were fully _UNK_ during the Tokyo trading session .
`` Most of the action was during the night session , `` said Michael Moore , trading manager at Continental Bank .
Jay _UNK_ , who often trades overnight for Capital _UNK_ Inc. , Beverly Hills , Calif. , said trading in Tokyo was `` very active `` but highly volatile .
`` We went down 3__4 point in 10 minutes right before lunch , then after lunch we went up 3__4 point in 12 minutes , `` he said .
In Tokyo , trading is halted during _UNK_ .
Tokyo `s market turned out to be a bad bellwether for U.S. trading .
When the market opened here , bonds prices fell as the stock market regained strength .
The bond market `s focus on stock activity was so strong yesterday that it _UNK_ today `s slate of economic data , which includes the government `s report on August U.S. merchandise trade and September industrial production .
Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2 % , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report .
The August trade deficit is expected to have widened to $ _UNK_ billion from $ _UNK_ billion in July .
A widening of that magnitude , said one New York trader , is `` not a favorable number ... .
It could do damage to us . ``
Meanwhile , agency supply is expected to weigh heavily on the market today when the Federal Home Loan Bank prices a $ 2.3 billion offering of one-year , three-year , five-year and 10-year maturities .

Resolution Funding is a division of Resolution Trust Corp. , the new federal agency created to bail out the nation `s troubled thrifts .
And this week the Tennessee Valley Authority plans to price a $ 3 billion offering , its first public debt borrowing in 15 years .
`` There `s lots of supply , `` the New York trader said .
`` We have a couple or three tough weeks coming . ``

Thus , higher bidding narrows the investor `s return while lower bidding widens it .
The percentage rates are calculated on a _UNK_ year , while the _UNK_ yield is based on a _UNK_ year .
Both issues are dated Oct. 19 .
The 13-week bills mature Jan. 18 , 1990 , and the _UNK_ bills mature April 19 , 1990 .

There was no new-issue activity in the derivative market .
Municipals
_UNK_ stocks and weaker Treasury prices drove municipal bonds 1__4 to 3__4 point lower in late dealings .
The session losses left municipal dollar bonds close to where they were before the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday prompted a capital markets rally .
Trading was _UNK_ during the morning , with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday `s free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness .
_UNK_ started the session flat to a touch higher on anticipation of further stock market erosion , but bond prices rapidly turned south as it became more clear that a repeat of the October 1987 crash was n`t at hand .

What does n`t belong here ?
A. _UNK_ _UNK_ , B. _UNK_ _UNK_ , C. radio _UNK_ shows .
If you _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ , you `re right .
After years of _UNK_ into the background , _UNK_ _UNK_ is coming back .
_UNK_ magazine _UNK_ feature _UNK_ _UNK_ photos of Hollywood _UNK_ _UNK_ jeans , shoes and liquor .
_UNK_ studios _UNK_ to _UNK_ only in color report a rush to _UNK_ _UNK_ orders .
And _UNK_ _UNK_ classes are crowded with students .
What `s happening in _UNK_ _UNK_ the popularity of black and white in fashion , home _UNK_ and _UNK_ .
On _UNK_ Avenue , _UNK_ have been advancing the _UNK_ look with clothing _UNK_ done entirely in black and white .
And classic _UNK_ movies are enjoying a comeback on _UNK_ tapes , spurred , in part , by the _UNK_ against _UNK_ of old films .
`` The _UNK_ is _UNK_ back to black and white , `` says Richard _UNK_ , the general manager of Eastman Kodak Co. `s professional _UNK_ division .
Until two years ago , sales of _UNK_ film had been declining steadily since the 1960s .
But last year , buoyed by increased use in advertising and other commercial applications , sales increased 5 % , and they are expected to jump at least that much again this year .
_UNK_ companies are scrambling to tap the _UNK_ market , _UNK_ some _UNK_ product lines and developing new ones .
At Kodak , which largely ignored the market for years , _UNK_ film sales now account for nearly 15 % of the company `s $ 3 billion in film and paper sales annually , up from 10 % three years ago .
The Rochester , N.Y. , photographic giant recently began marketing _UNK_ _UNK_ , one of the _UNK_ and most sensitive _UNK_ films .
_UNK_ at commercial _UNK_ , the film can be used in very low light without _UNK_ quality , says Donald _UNK_ of _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Also trying to _UNK_ a portion of the $ 2 _UNK_ industry is _UNK_ Corp. , a unit of _UNK_ AG .
_UNK_ recently signed _UNK_ gold _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ to _UNK_ a new line of _UNK_ paper that `s _UNK_ to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak `s papers .
_UNK_ for market by the end of the year , the paper `` could have been introduced a long time ago but the market was n`t there then , `` says an _UNK_ spokesman .
The biggest _UNK_ of the _UNK_ revival is likely to be International Paper Co. `s _UNK_ division , known in the industry for its premium products .
Sales of _UNK_ `s four _UNK_ of _UNK_ film this year are _UNK_ growth in the overall market , although the company wo n`t say by exactly how much .
`` We hope the trend lasts , `` says _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ `s marketing communications director .
Why all the interest ?
For baby boomers who grew up being _UNK_ in color , black and white seems _UNK_ and exotic .
`` It has an _UNK_ , almost _UNK_ quality to it , `` says Owen B. _UNK_ , the chairman of the applied _UNK_ department at Rochester Institute of Technology .
`` You can shift out of reality with black and white , `` he adds .
Such features have been especially attractive to professional _UNK_ and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising .
_UNK_ of _UNK_ commercial film jumped 24 % last year to 18.7 million rolls .
Consider _UNK_ Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features _UNK_ shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well-known _UNK_ _UNK_ the retailer `s jeans and _UNK_ .
Richard _UNK_ , the account manager for the campaign , says _UNK_ did n`t _UNK_ choose black and white to _UNK_ its ads from the color spreads of competitors .
`` We wanted to highlight the individual , not the environment , `` he says , `` and black and white allows you to do that better than color . ``
The campaign won a _UNK_ award as this year `s best ad by a specialty retailer .
Even food products and automobiles , which have long _UNK_ on color , are making the switch .
Companies `` feel black and white will _UNK_ a stronger statement , `` says _UNK_ L. _UNK_ , a Chicago _UNK_ who is working on a _UNK_ print ad for _UNK_ Food Corp. `s _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Other companies that are currently using _UNK_ ads include American Express Co. and _UNK_ America Inc .
_UNK_ studios have also _UNK_ onto the trend .
Using black and white , `` we can make _UNK_ look like stars , `` says John _UNK_ .
His _UNK_ _UNK_ studio in _UNK_ , Ore. , doubled its business last year and , he says , is _UNK_ solid for the next five .
One customer , _UNK_ _UNK_ , says she _UNK_ a color _UNK_ for black and white because `` it `s more dramatic .
I show it to my friends , and they all say ` _UNK_ . `
It is n`t ordinary like color . ``
Still , most consumers are n`t _UNK_ _UNK_ film into their cameras to take family _UNK_ .
One big obstacle is that few _UNK_ develop the film anymore .
Typically , it must be _UNK_ to a handful of processors and may take a week or more to be processed and returned .
_UNK_ film costs consumers a little less than color film , and processing costs the same .
But for _UNK_ , developing costs for _UNK_ film are higher .
Some companies are starting to tackle that problem .
_UNK_ , for example , recently introduced a _UNK_ film that can be processed quickly by color labs .
_UNK_ on _UNK_ customers , the company is also increasing its _UNK_ of _UNK_ _UNK_ classes .
Similarly , _UNK_ is _UNK_ scores of _UNK_ _UNK_ at high schools and colleges , offering free _UNK_ film and paper as _UNK_ .
And Kodak is _UNK_ an _UNK_ video to processors on how to develop its _UNK_ film more efficiently .
Other companies are introducing related products .
Charles _UNK_ Co. , a leading maker of photographic _UNK_ , introduced last month a complete _UNK_ _UNK_ _UNK_ targeted at _UNK_ who want to process their own _UNK_ _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ , which has a suggested retail price of $ 250 and has already become a _UNK_ , was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children `s _UNK_ equipment .
`` It seems computers as _UNK_ have _UNK_ , `` says _UNK_ _UNK_ , _UNK_ `s chairman and chief executive officer .
But some industry observers believe the _UNK_ of black and white is only a _UNK_ .
They cite the _UNK_ of still electronic _UNK_ , more newspapers turning to color on their pages and _UNK_ improvements in the quality of color _UNK_ .
`` Black and white has n`t made the same _UNK_ _UNK_ in technological development as color , `` says Mr. _UNK_ of the Rochester Institute .
`` The color print today is far superior to _UNK_ of 10 years ago .
You ca n`t say the same with black and white . ``
But when Popular _UNK_ , a leading magazine for _UNK_ , selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue _UNK_ _UNK_ `s _UNK_ anniversary , all were black and white .
`` It `s got a classic spirit and carries over _UNK_ , `` says Alfred _UNK_ of Professional _UNK_ of America .
`` That `s the appeal .
_UNK_ _UNK_ Inc. said improvements in advertising and _UNK_ revenue led to a 21 % gain in third-quarter profit to $ 8.8 million , or 31 cents a share , from $ 7.2 million , or 25 cents a share .
Sales rose more than 7 % to $ _UNK_ million from $ _UNK_ million .
The Sacramento , Calif. , company also attributed improved performance to a lower effective tax rate and higher interest income .
For the nine months , the newspaper chain had almost a 23 % increase in profit to $ _UNK_ million , or 83 cents a share , from $ _UNK_ million , or 68 cents a share .
Sales grew almost 7 % to $ _UNK_ million from $ _UNK_ million .
_UNK_ publishes the Sacramento -LRB- Calif . -RRB- _UNK_ and _UNK_ -LRB- Wash . -RRB- News Tribune , and other papers in Western states .
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the company closed at $ _UNK_ a share , down 25 cents .
_UNK_ S.p . A. and Societe National _UNK_ _UNK_ , the state oil companies of Italy and France , respectively , submitted an offer to buy _UNK_ Suisse S.A .
The price was n`t disclosed .
A spokesman for _UNK_ said that the Swiss oil concern was _UNK_ the offer , submitted last Friday , along with two other offers , also submitted last week .
Those two offers were private and the spokesman refused to identify the bidding companies .
The spokesman further said that at least two more offers are expected from other companies within two weeks .
_UNK_ Suisse owns an oil refinery in Switzerland with a capacity of 70,000 barrels a day , along with a network of gasoline retailing outlets .
While Friday `s plunging stock market prompted new fears about the economy `s prospects , a _UNK_ indicator that has _UNK_ _UNK_ the economy `s _UNK_ and _UNK_ by _UNK_ long lead times points to a sustained rise in overall business activity .
The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University `s Center for International Business _UNK_ Research here , reached a record high of _UNK_ in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then .
The latest reading of _UNK_ was up from _UNK_ in July and _UNK_ as recently as March .
The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100 .
In contrast , the Commerce Department `s widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year .
Its _UNK_ behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some _UNK_ to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year `s end .
But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , `` says _UNK_ H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility .
A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business _UNK_ _UNK_ Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when _UNK_ and recessions begin and end .
The group normally _UNK_ only when a change in the economy `s general course seems likely .
`` No meeting is scheduled because the expansion shows no sign of going off the tracks , `` Mr. Moore reports .
Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts _UNK_ _UNK_ economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well .
They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation .
_UNK_ this optimism is the index `s longstanding ability to signal recessions or _UNK_ , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department `s index of leading indicators .
Over the full _UNK_ War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the _UNK_ of recessions and turned up eight months before _UNK_ .
The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far shorter -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before _UNK_ .
The Columbia economists also have _UNK_ how the long leading index would have _UNK_ , had it existed , in _UNK_ , before the stock market crash in October that _UNK_ in the Great _UNK_ .
The indicator reached a peak in January _UNK_ and then fell steadily up to and through the crash .
`` It was an entirely different pattern from what we `re seeing now , `` Mr. Moore says .
A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate _UNK_ index , which is not a part of the Commerce index .
In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 .
It also rose last Friday , while the stock market _UNK_ .
Other components of the long leading indicator include a ratio of prices to unit labor costs in manufacturing industries , the _UNK_ version of the money supply , adjusted for inflation , and the volume of new _UNK_ permits .
_UNK_ _UNK_ from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy `s _UNK_ prospects , though it still is useful for _UNK_ some _UNK_ _UNK_ and turns . ``
As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor `s index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index .
It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components .
The stock market has lost some _UNK_ power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments .
`` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , `` Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the _UNK_ balance and inflows of foreign capital .
He also feels that the rise of such _UNK_ practices as program trading has diminished the stock market `s _UNK_ to the economic outlook .
_UNK_ S.A. , a leading French food group , said it agreed to acquire _UNK_ _UNK_ . H. , a West German _UNK_ maker .
The value of the acquisition was n`t disclosed .

An American journalist now is standing trial in _UNK_ .
This is the place that world opinion has been _UNK_ over in the expectation that it `s going to hold an election .
The most likely winner will be the _UNK_ _UNK_ rebels .
The U.S. journalist `s `` crime `` was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election `s fairness , _UNK_ _UNK_ , was openly sympathetic to _UNK_ .
Shortly after that , Mr. _UNK_ had Scott Stanley arrested and his _UNK_ confiscated .
Mr. Stanley is on trial over charges that he violated a _UNK_ , issued by the South African administrator general earlier this year , which made it a crime _UNK_ by two years in prison for any person to `` _UNK_ , _UNK_ or _UNK_ `` the election commission .
The Stanley affair does n`t _UNK_ well for the future of democracy or freedom of anything in _UNK_ when _UNK_ starts running the government .
To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the _UNK_ guerrillas were above all else the victims of _UNK_ by neighboring South Africa .
_UNK_ has enjoyed favorable Western media treatment ever since the U.N. General Assembly declared it the `` sole , _UNK_ representative `` of _UNK_ `s people in
Last year , the U.S. _UNK_ a peace settlement to remove Cuba `s `` _UNK_ _UNK_ `` from _UNK_ and hold `` free and fair `` elections that would end South Africa `s control of _UNK_ .

In July , Mr. Stanley , editor of American Press International , a Washington _UNK_ conservative wire service , visited _UNK_ to report on the _UNK_ election campaign .

After Mr. Stanley `s article was published in two _UNK_ newspapers , Mr. _UNK_ had criminal charges brought against their editors , publisher and lawyer .
Mr. Stanley was arrested and charged along with the others when he returned to _UNK_ this month .
Both the State Department and the Lawyers Committee for Freedom of the Press have _UNK_ Mr. Stanley `s _UNK_ .
Mr. Stanley `s arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to _UNK_ _UNK_ `s elections .
Both South African and _UNK_ _UNK_ are _UNK_ voters .
The U.S. is in the _UNK_ of arranging peace settlements and then _UNK_ its hands over the _UNK_ results .
It now has the chance to _UNK_ that record in _UNK_ .
State and the human-rights community should insist that Mr. Stanley and his fellow defendants be released and that the United _UNK_ `s monitors make certain that Mr. _UNK_ commission _UNK_ election complaints from all sides .
Commodity futures prices generally reflected the stability of the stock market following its plunge Friday .
Yesterday , the stock market `s influence at first created _UNK_ .
Later , however , it became more of an _UNK_ than a _UNK_ force as individual markets reacted more to their own factors .
Gold , the traditional haven in times of financial crisis , continued its _UNK_ _UNK_ with the dollar , rising early in the day as the currency fell , and then giving up some of its gains as the dollar recovered .
Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy .
Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved .
Crude oil declined early , but as the stock market retained early gains , it , too , became stronger , ending with a small net loss .
Trading in cotton and sugar was nervous and showed small declines .
In Chicago , grain and soybean prices rose slightly .
_UNK_ and meat prices , however , dropped on concern that a financial crisis would cut consumption of beef and pork .
In commodity markets yesterday : _UNK_ _UNK_ : Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum _UNK_ _UNK_ , first falling and then later rising .
Silver performed quietly .
The spot October gold price rose $ 4 to $ _UNK_ an ounce .
The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $ _UNK_ an ounce at $ _UNK_ , after trading as high as $ _UNK_ .
December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $ _UNK_ .
_UNK_ _UNK_ more like an industrial metal , easing early on concern over a possible weaker economy , but recovering later , as the stock market strengthened .
Gold was _UNK_ the spectacular performer it was two years ago on Black Monday .
For one thing , last Friday , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its _UNK_ nose dive , so it could n`t react to it .
Back on Friday , Oct. 16 , _UNK_ , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell .
The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ 8.70 to as high as $ _UNK_ , and the more deferred positions , due to mature as late as March 1989 , rose as much as $ _UNK_ .
On Black Monday , Oct. 19 , 1987 , the October contract _UNK_ on further gains , rising to as high as $ _UNK_ for a gain of almost $ 20 on top of the Friday advances , before giving up almost $ 10 of that at the close .
Yesterday `s October gain of $ 4 was _UNK_ compared with that .
One analyst , Peter _UNK_ of _UNK_ & Co. , New York , said the gold market already had some good _UNK_ technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market .
`` What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , `` said Mr. _UNK_ .
There `s a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said .
He expects a drop in interest rates , which would help gold by keeping the dollar from rising .
Finally , according to Mr. _UNK_ , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released today .
This would be damaging to the dollar and _UNK_ for gold , he said .
_UNK_ :
_UNK_ that Friday `s 190-point stock market plunge might be a _UNK_ of things to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices .
The U.S. benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate , closed at $ _UNK_ a barrel for November delivery , down 30 cents .
Some analysts said crude was due for a correction _UNK_ , following several days of significant gains .
But most market observers agreed that Friday `s stock market drop is what _UNK_ spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday .
Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong .
The Organization of Petroleum _UNK_ _UNK_ increased its production ceiling for the fourth quarter based on projections of robust demand .
So any bearish indicator , such as Friday `s _UNK_ drop in the stock market , sends _UNK_ through the oil markets as well .
Indeed , after reacting early in the trading day to Friday `s _UNK_ , futures prices firmed up again as traders took note of the stock market `s partial recovery yesterday .
_UNK_ :
Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been _UNK_ prices appeared to be solved .
The December contract declined _UNK_ cents a pound to $ _UNK_ .
Prices were down from the _UNK_ of trading on concern that a drop in the stock market might create a weakened economy and a _UNK_ reduction in copper use .
But the recovery in the stock market provided little help for copper as word spread that a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia was about over , according to an analyst .
Highland Valley is a large Canadian producer and principal supplier to Japan , which recently began seeking copper elsewhere as its inventories _UNK_ .
Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company .
Now , the analyst said , only minor points remain to be _UNK_ up .
`` For all _UNK_ and purposes , an agreement appears to have been achieved , `` he said .
Copper inventories in New York `s Commodity Exchange _UNK_ rose yesterday by _UNK_ tons , to _UNK_ tons .
London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined _UNK_ tons , to _UNK_ tons .
The _UNK_ stocks decline was about as expected , but the Comex gain was n`t .
However , this was _UNK_ aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said .
At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ _UNK_ , but it was n`t able to sustain the gain .
`` It was simply _UNK_ , `` he said , and selling by funds that are computer _UNK_ helped depress prices .
_UNK_ :
Futures prices eased , more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market .
The December contract ended with a loss of _UNK_ cent a pound , at _UNK_ cents .
_UNK_ considerations following the hurricane , which was a factor in the market Friday , caused prices to decline yesterday , said Ernest Simon , cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities , New York .
Prices rose sharply Friday as the storm approached Texas and Louisiana , which is part of the Mississippi Delta _UNK_ area .
However , after _UNK_ the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip late Friday , Mr. Simon said .
That selling continued yesterday and kept prices under pressure , he said .
_UNK_ weather is being predicted for the high _UNK_ of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend , Mr. Simon said .
That has n`t yet captured traders ` attention , he added .
_UNK_ :
Futures prices declined .
The March contract was off _UNK_ cent a pound at _UNK_ cents .
At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as _UNK_ cents when the stock market recovered , but the price then fell back .
A _UNK_ factor , one analyst said , was that India , which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market , did n`t make any purchases .
India recently bought 200,000 tons and was expected to buy more , the analyst said .
Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market .
`` India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , `` said _UNK_ _UNK_ , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York .
At any rate , she added , `` India needs the sugar , so it will be in sooner or later to buy it . ``
_UNK_ _UNK_ :
The prices of cattle and _UNK_ futures contracts dropped sharply because traders speculated that the stock market plunge Friday will _UNK_ in the minds of U.S. consumers long enough to prompt them to rein in their spending at the supermarket , which would hurt demand for beef and pork .
The price of the _UNK_ contract for October delivery dropped its maximum _UNK_ daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound .
The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering .
Earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows .
A broad rally began when several major processors began buying futures contracts , apparently to take advantage of the price dip .
Knight-Ridder Inc. said it would report increased earnings per share for the third quarter , contrary to reported analysts ` comments that the publishing company `s earnings would be down .
A company spokesman said he believed the confusion was caused when James _UNK_ , Knight-Ridder `s chairman and chief executive , told New York analysts two weeks ago that Knight-Ridder `s earnings per share for the first nine months of 1989 would `` be behind a little bit `` from like period of
The Knight-Ridder spokesman said the third-quarter earnings that the company plans to report Oct. 24 are expected to be up .

In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Knight-Ridder closed at $ _UNK_ , down 37.5 cents .
_UNK_ Acquisition Corp. said it extended its $ _UNK_ offer for Dunkin ` Donuts Inc. to Nov. 1 from yesterday .
The offer has an indicated value of $ _UNK_ million .
_UNK_ Acquisition is a partnership of _UNK_ Canada Corp. `s _UNK_ Capital Group unit and _UNK_ Operations Ltd .
As previously reported , under the terms of a _UNK_ agreement with Dunkin ` Donuts , the partners agreed to keep their offer open until Nov. 1 , and not to acquire any additional shares except through a tender offer _UNK_ on that date .

Herbert M. _UNK_ , chairman and chief executive officer of the Oakland , Calif. , savings-and-loan holding company , credited the high number of loans added to the company `s portfolio over the last 12 months for _UNK_ its earning asset base and improving profit performance .

The maker of home appliances said the process , which involves the use of a _UNK_ plastic bag during repairs to _UNK_ the _UNK_ substance and transport it to a recycling center , is already in use at a number of its service centers , and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring .
Earlier repairs _UNK_ the CFCs out of the home through a _UNK_ directly into the atmosphere .
CFCs are widely used as _UNK_ , _UNK_ and fire _UNK_ .
But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth `s ozone layer , and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use , or at least _UNK_ , of the substance .
_UNK_ said , `` We see this process as a small but important step toward eventual elimination of _UNK_ use in _UNK_ manufacture .
_UNK_ Energy Corp. , Dallas , said it discovered a new oil field _UNK_ of its previously discovered _UNK_ Field in the _UNK_ _UNK_ area of _UNK_ .
_UNK_ said it did n`t run a production test on the three discovery wells it _UNK_ in the field , which is about 1.6 miles from the _UNK_ Field , because the wells are similar to others _UNK_ at its _UNK_ and _UNK_ fields .
However , _UNK_ said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil .
The _UNK_ Field has estimated reserves of 50 million barrels and the _UNK_ Field has estimated reserves of 225 million barrels .

For the moment , at least , euphoria has replaced anxiety on Wall Street .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at _UNK_ , panic did n`t sweep the world `s markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday `s dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction , not a _UNK_ .
Many went _UNK_ .
Among those _UNK_ with relief was John H. Gutfreund , chairman of Salomon Brothers , who took to the firm `s trading floor to monitor yesterday `s events .
As the rally gained strength at _UNK_ p.m. , he _UNK_ broadly , _UNK_ his _UNK_ _UNK_ and _UNK_ Stanley _UNK_ , his top stock trader , on the back .
At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself .
As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation `s biggest companies could n`t open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers .
By _UNK_ , the Dow _UNK_ were off _UNK_ points , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles had kicked off Friday `s plunge , still had n`t opened .
But then , as quickly as the Dow had fallen , it began to turn around .
It ended with a gain of _UNK_ points .
By the market `s close , volume on the New York exchange totaled more than _UNK_ million , the fourth highest on record .
The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987 .
But the rally was largely _UNK_ to the blue-chip stocks , which had been hard hit during Friday `s selling frenzy .
Overall , more Big Board stocks lost money than gained .
And many arbitragers , already _UNK_ from Friday `s collapse of the UAL deal , were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines , collapsed .
Indeed , the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged _UNK_ points , its _UNK_ drop in history .
_UNK_ , trading was generally _UNK_ .
The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets , with blue chips there falling _UNK_ % .
In London , a midday rally left the market `s major index off 3.2 % , and Tokyo `s leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading .
Other , more _UNK_ traded Asian markets were hit harder than Tokyo `s , but there were no _UNK_ declines .
Investors big and small say they learned valuable _UNK_ since the 1987 crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge _UNK_ or _UNK_ in a few hours ` time must be expected .
What `s more , such short-term _UNK_ are _UNK_ and are no cause for panic selling .
Stephen _UNK_ , a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore , says , `` There was less panic than in 1987 : We had been through it once . ``
In _UNK_ , Wis. , _UNK_ _UNK_ , who owns a supplier of _UNK_ equipment and is n`t active in the stock market , agrees .
`` I look at it as a _UNK_ matter , `` he says .
Many other factors played a part in yesterday `s comeback .
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day .
Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts .
The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to _UNK_ yen , bounced back strongly to _UNK_ , thus easing fears that foreigners would unload U.S. stocks .
And the widely _UNK_ opinion among most market experts that a crash was n`t in store also helped calm investors .
Many major institutions , for example , came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday .
Still , amid all the _UNK_ and signs of relief over yesterday `s events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday `s .
`` There is too much _UNK_ , `` says money manager Barry _UNK_ .
Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world-wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe .
So investors everywhere _UNK_ _UNK_ yesterday `s opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a _UNK_ start .
The average plunged some 600 points , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading .
But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down _UNK_ .
Unlike two years ago , most of Japan `s major investors chose to sit this _UNK_ out .
In Merrill Lynch & Co. `s Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and _UNK_ sat quietly , with few orders to process .
_UNK_ `` are all staying out `` of the market , one Merrill trader says .

_UNK_ in the sale are _UNK_ units that make men `s _UNK_ under the _UNK_ name , _UNK_ under the Gold _UNK_ name and _UNK_ through the _UNK_ division .
The companies said the agreement is subject to _UNK_ `s _UNK_ of financing and to regulatory and other approvals .
They said the sale is expected to be concluded by the end of November .
Mr. _UNK_ said the sale of three of _UNK_ `s four main divisions plus other `` anticipated `` West _UNK_ asset sales by December , should bring in a total of about $ 700 million .

Britain `s Blue _UNK_ PLC intends to change its name to _UNK_ PLC and write off a chunk of the nearly $ 1.2 billion in good will realized in the takeover of _UNK_ _UNK_ Inc .
Blue _UNK_ Chairman Mitchell _UNK_ said in an interview that the two steps may be a prelude to _UNK_ the world `s biggest _UNK_ group in the U.S. .
Mr. _UNK_ disclosed the planned steps , expected within a few months , as Blue _UNK_ posted a 2.5 % drop in its third-quarter pretax earnings .
The name change and good will write-off could help _UNK_ Blue _UNK_ `s dominance of the U.S. _UNK_ market and give it a more American image as U.S. investors turn jittery about foreign stocks after Friday `s market plunge .
U.S. holders now own more than 60 % of Blue _UNK_ compared with 9 % last January .
`` In the U.S. market , the recognition of the _UNK_ name is _UNK_ stronger than Blue _UNK_ , `` Mr. _UNK_ said .
The moves also could _UNK_ shareholders ` perception of Blue _UNK_ as a company in turmoil .
`` It further _UNK_ the concept that Blue _UNK_ is a thing of the past , `` said Doug Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York .
The proposed changes `` all make a lot of sense to me , `` he added .
In a widely publicized _UNK_ coup , Mr. _UNK_ ousted _UNK_ Berry as Blue _UNK_ chief executive in January , a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. _UNK_ out as the $ 1 _UNK_ chief of _UNK_ _UNK_ .
Mr. _UNK_ _UNK_ his control in April by taking over from Mr. Berry as chairman .
But the Blue _UNK_ _UNK_ is n`t over yet , as the British government is investigating a disputed # 25 million -LRB- $ _UNK_ million -RRB- loan which Mr. _UNK_ has said was made under Mr. Berry `s direction .
Blue _UNK_ was able to pull off the $ _UNK_ billion takeover of _UNK_ in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies .
Under British rules , Blue _UNK_ was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will _UNK_ from the purchase .
As a _UNK_ company , Blue _UNK_ would have to _UNK_ the good will over as many as 40 years , creating a continuing drag on reported earnings .
Good will is the excess of cost of an acquired firm , operating unit or assets over the current or fair market value of those assets .
But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue _UNK_ reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards .
`` Our balance sheets look like they came from _UNK_ `s _UNK_ , `` Mr. _UNK_ said .
The British version shows `` a handful of pounds of net worth `` following the 1987 write-off of good will , while the American version reflects `` $ 1 billion of net worth because almost none of -LCB- the good will -RCB- has been written off . ``
Mr. _UNK_ said he hopes to _UNK_ some of the good will left on Blue _UNK_ `s U.S. books in one fell _UNK_ , but would n`t specify how much .
People close to Blue _UNK_ suggested the write-down would represent a sizable chunk , with executives claiming prior management _UNK_ the extent of _UNK_ `s good will .
That move , along with the return to the _UNK_ name , could bolster the company `s prospects during possibly difficult times for temporary help .
The number of U.S. temporary workers fell about 1 % in the 12 months ending Aug. 31 , after sliding nearly 3.5 % in July , said Kidder Peabody `s Mr. Arthur .
Blue _UNK_ blamed the pretax profit drop in the quarter ended July 31 partly on slower earnings growth of _UNK_ units in Britain .
Overall , pretax profit slid to # _UNK_ million in the quarter from # _UNK_ million a year earlier .
Richard G. _UNK_ , the man credited with _UNK_ Applied Power Inc. from an _UNK_ into a _UNK_ player in the global market for _UNK_ tools , hopes to guide a similar turnaround at the company `s latest acquisition , Barry Wright Corp .
The _UNK_ former General Electric Co. executive figures it will be easier this time .
But analysts , while _UNK_ the acquisition , say Applied `s chief executive faces a tough challenge in _UNK_ the two companies .
Barry Wright , acquired by Applied for $ _UNK_ million , makes _UNK_ equipment and _UNK_ systems .
The _UNK_ , Mass. , company `s sales have been _UNK_ and its profits have dropped .
Last year `s earnings of $ 1.3 million , including $ _UNK_ from a restructuring gain , were far below the year-earlier $ 8.4 million .
Besides _UNK_ Barry Wright `s sales , which were $ _UNK_ million in 1988 , Mr. _UNK_ must _UNK_ its costs and product line .
`` The question is how long it `s going to take Barry Wright to make a contribution , `` says F. John _UNK_ , an analyst at _UNK_ Ellis _UNK_ in _UNK_ .
The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. _UNK_ .
The _UNK_ , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ _UNK_ a share in August 1987 , and Mr. _UNK_ `s goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 .
Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988 .
The stock has since _UNK_ , trading around $ 25 a share last week and closing yesterday at $ _UNK_ in national over-the-counter trading .
But Mr. _UNK_ has set a fresh target of $ 50 a share by the end of
_UNK_ that goal , says Robert T. _UNK_ , Applied `s chief financial officer , will require `` efficient _UNK_ `` of cash by Applied and _UNK_ of its healthy 19 % rate of return on operating capital .
In Barry Wright , Mr. _UNK_ sees a situation `` very similar `` to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 .
Applied , then a closely held company , was _UNK_ under the management of its controlling family .
While profitable , it `` was n`t growing and was n`t providing a _UNK_ return on invested capital , `` he says .
Mr. _UNK_ is confident that the drive to dominate certain niche markets will work at Barry Wright as it has at Applied .
He also _UNK_ an `` _UNK_ `` _UNK_ to develop a corporate culture that rewards managers who produce and where _UNK_ is shared .
Mr. _UNK_ considers the new unit `s operations `` fundamentally sound `` and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n`t interested larger competitors .
`` With a little _UNK_ , these businesses will perform very _UNK_ , `` Mr. _UNK_ says .
Within about six months , `` things will be moving in the right direction , `` he predicts .
Mr. _UNK_ figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he `s now in the driver `s seat .
When he came to Applied , `` I did n`t have the power to execute as I do today , `` he says .
He was named chief executive officer of Applied in 1986 and became chairman last November .
At Applied , Mr. _UNK_ set growth as his first objective .
He took the company public in an offering that _UNK_ Applied about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company `s acquisition program .
Sales climbed to an estimated $ _UNK_ million in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ _UNK_ million in fiscal 1985 .
The company expects that earnings , which have _UNK_ steadily upward in recent years , reached about $ _UNK_ million , or $ _UNK_ a share , in the fiscal year just ended , up from $ _UNK_ million in fiscal 1988 and $ 3.9 million in 1985 .
